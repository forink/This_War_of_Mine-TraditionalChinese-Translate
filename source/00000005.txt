Crude Stove
It's as simple as they get: just burn some fuel made up of wood, books or components and use some water to cook a meal more nutritious than raw food.
Improved Stove
A more efficient stove. Allows us to prepare cooked food more efficiently, saving fuel.
Herbal Garden
Using fertilizer we can grow some herbs here and use them to make medication or cheap cigarettes. We can improve it to grow vegetables.
Herbal Workshop
A table with some simple equipment where we can prepare herbal meds, bandages and low quality roll-up cigarettes. We can upgrade it to make real meds and good quality cigarettes.
Simple Heater
Allows us to heat the shelter, so that we don't get ill. We can prepare fuel for it using wood, books or various components.
Improved Heater
It heats up the shelter much more efficiently using less fuel.
Bed
Offers a decent sleep without back pain, no matter if it's night or day.
Radio
It would be great to listen to current news and weather forecasts. We could be better prepared to deal with hardships if we knew about them well in advance. When there's nothing on the news, we can listen to music and brighten up our mood.
Moonshine Still
With a bit of patience, some water and sugar we can make a foul-tasting but strong booze. We could then barter it for things we need. Just don't expect too much.
Alcohol Distiller
Distills moonshine into pure, high-quality alcohol, component for meds and bandages, or a bartering item.
Simple Workshop
An improvised workbench for making simple equipment, furniture and other useful stuff, such as beds or chairs. We can upgrade it to make even more useful things.
Improved Workshop
Enables the manufacture of more sophisticated items and appliances, providing us with more options to get food or meds, and trade goods. We can upgrade it further to make electrical improvements.
Rainwater Collector
A simple contraption to collect and filter rainwater needed for cooking and making alcohol. It might be wise to build a couple of them.
Pile of Snow
Armchair
An armchair is a comfortable piece of furniture. If you sit in it with a good book, you can almost forget about the war.
Chair
It's better to sit on a chair than on the floor. We should build it to make this place more like home. It will make us feel better in these tough times.
Trap for small animals
The only small animals left seem to be rats... Still, meat is a rare commodity in wartime. We simply have to put in some bait and wait.
Advanced Workshop
This advanced workshop allows us to make useful electrical appliances, such as heat lamps for gardens and mixers for herbal workshops or for metal workshops.
Guitar
Having something to occupy time is important. A guitar can brighten up our mood, especially if the person playing it knows what they are doing.
We can grow vegetables here using water and fertilizer, but it takes time.
Vegetable Garden
Reinforced Door
Once we board up holes and windows in the shelter, we can think of reinforcing the door and installing a simple alarm system.
Board up
We can board up holes and windows in the building for more protection against looters.
Metal Workshop
Allows us to make tools, such as shovels for clearing rubble, crowbars for breaking doors and knives for self-defense. Later we could use it to build more advanced tools or even repair firearms.
Improved Metal Workshop
Apart from making more tools such as an axe or saw blade, we can also fix simple broken firearms and helmets here. We can upgrade it even further to make ammo and fix bulletproof vests.
Advanced Metal Workshop
Apart from making tools we can fix all broken firearms here, as well as vests and helmets, and refill empty shell casings to reuse them.
Improved Herbal workshop
It enables the manufacture of real meds and quality roll-up cigarettes.
Wood
An essential component for all kinds of stuff, plus we can chop it to fuel stoves and heaters.
Components
Various components needed to make just about anything. Nails, duct tape, plastic containers, scrap, things like that.
Gunpowder
Gunpowder is used to manufacture ammunition and explosives.
Weapon Parts
Various weapon parts. Blades, barrels, springs, locks and so on.
Sugar
There'd be no moonshine without sugar. Essential for the fermentation process.
Parts
Various mechanical parts. Used for building and fixing complex devices.
Herbs
Tobacco
We can make expensive cigarettes from this tobacco.
Various herbs that can be used to make herbal medications and roll-up cigarettes.
Herbs
Med ingredients
Old pills and animal meds. With a little bit of knowledge they can be used to make normal meds.
Empty shotgun shells. We could use them to make shotgun ammo.
Shotgun Shells
Shell Casings
Empty shell casings. We could make firearm ammo out of them.
Rifle Shells
Empty rifle shells. We could make rifle ammo out of them.
Fertilizer
Organic waste that we can use as fertilizer in our garden to grow herbs or vegetables, or as bait in a trap for small animals.
Electric Parts
Some electric parts. They will come in handy if we want to introduce advanced improvements to our shelter.
Speaker
An essential part of any radio receiver.
Broken Pistol
An old weapon with a few missing parts.
Broken Assault Rifle
It used to be a deadly weapon, but it doesn't work anymore.

It's damaged so badly it can't be used, but after some repairs it could save someone's head.
Damaged Vest
Damaged military vest. Some repairs are needed before it can be used again.
Broken Guitar
It's broken, but not beyond repair. It would be cool to pass the time with nice music.
Conduct Pass
A safe conduct pass issued by the local army headquarters to Robert Zhigajev. It’s useless to us, but could be quite valuable for someone with access to a skilled forger.
Raw Food
It's edible but would be more nutritious when cooked.
Cooked Food
A simple cooked meal, more nutritious and tastier than raw food. It gets even better and more filling with vegetables.
Ammunition
Ammunition for firearms.
Pure Alcohol
A small flask of pure alcohol. You can drink it, you can trade it or you can use it to produce meds or bandages.
Medications
Their taste is terrible, but they can save your life in sickness.
Bandages
Used to dress wounds.
Canned Food
A canned meal, more nutritious than raw food. With time, you'll get used to its taste.

Jarred Food
It doesn't spoil so we can store it longer, and it's good for trade.
Shotgun Ammo
Ammunition for shotguns.
Rifle Ammo
Ammunition for rifles.
Herbal Meds
Simple medications based on herbs. Sometimes they help, sometimes they don't. Still, they're better than nothing.
Dismantling Tools
Tools for dismantling electrical and mechanical devices. Screwdrivers, files, cutters and the like. They're homemade, so not very durable.
Vegetables
We can eat them as is, but they make a much better meal when cooked with some raw food.
Saw Blade
We can use it to cut through metal bars and chains to get to otherwise inaccessible places.
Homegrown Tobacco
Homegrown tobacco for making roll-up cigarettes. Not nearly as good as the real thing, but we can grow it ourselves.
Roll-up Cigarette
Roll-up cigarette made from herbs. It reeks acrid, bitter smoke.
Cigarette
Real tobacco cigarette. Often used as currency in times of war.
Quality Roll-up
Roll-up made from equal parts of tobacco and herbs. Quite good under the circumstances.

Filter
Homemade single-use filter to purify rainwater or distill alcohol.
Snow
We can melt it into water.
Fuel
Everything that we can burn in the heater to warm up our place, or in the stove to cook food. We can make it from wood, books or components.
Book
A good book is uplifting. The more we have, the better. If times are hard, we can make them into fuel for our heater or stove.

Heat Lamp
We can use this lamp to grow plants indoors.
Mixer
We can use it to mix gunpowder or medicine ingredients.
Thermo regulator

I shouldn't take any more meds today.
I don't need to change my bandages yet.
I shouldn't take any more meds today.
One more sip and I'll puke.
I could drink a lot more, but let's save something for my buddies!
It's empty. We ought to search for food.
No medication left.
We don't have any bandages.
Good, it's getting warmer...
The heater's working just fine.
The fire's nice and warm.
Hmm... nothing yet. I guess we have to wait.
Still nothing. Gotta have patience.
The bait's still there. I hope we catch something soon.
If I keep standing here, no rat will come near the trap.
The filter is set. All I have to do now is wait.
Filtering takes some time, gotta have patience.
It's working, we just have to wait.
Staring at it won't make it filter faster.
Distillation under way, we just have to wait.
Purifying alcohol takes some time.
I could stand here all day and watch, but I don't need to.
I feel like an alchemist turning something cheap into gold.
They're planted. Now we have to wait.
Simply let nature do its work.
There's no point in standing here all day.
Staring at them won't make them grow faster.
It's all set, now let's wait for the results.
Sugar fermentation takes some time, gotta be patient.
Just let the yeast do its work.
The moonshine will be ready soon, we just have to wait.
Soon we'll have some fresh vegetables!
It'll take some time for them to grow.
I wish I could make them grow faster, but I can't.
We're fortunate. Vegetables are hard to come by nowadays.
Not very filling, but it's food...
Too bad it isn't cooked.
Not very tasty, but it's filling.
That feels better.
They say these cans are quite nutritious.
A proper meal at last.
That's some real food!
These pills should help...
I'll probably start feeling better soon...
That's the right dose for today.
Now it should heal.
The pain should ease soon.
I hope I'll get better now.
I'd rather they were cooked...
Not very satiating...
I guess they're better than nothing.
These should do in a pinch...
I hope these will help me.
I think I've taken enough for today.
It's good to have a drink once in a while.
Good... I needed that.
Nothing better to brighten up the mood!
It's good to have a drink once in a while.
Good... I needed that.
Nothing better to brighten up the mood!
Enough sleeping.
Nothing like a good sleep.
All right, now I've rested.
I'm not tired.
Tempting, but there's no time to lounge.
I've had enough sleep.
It's already full of fuel.
No need to throw more fuel in.
There's enough fuel inside.
It's frozen. I will have to melt snow from the pile outside to get some water.
It's useless in this cold, but we can melt snow from the pile outside.
It's completely frozen. I'd better just gather some snow and melt it.
We've got no fuel, maybe we should chop some wood.
We need to have something to burn. Wood or books will do.
We'd better check if we have something to burn.
These won't help me. I need something stronger.
I need real meds. These won't do.
I'm too sick for these to be of any good.
I can't eat any more.
I'm fine, we might need these bandages someday.
I feel fine, let's save the meds for later.
Shit, the shovel just broke!
This shovel is useless now!
My crowbar is broken!
My crowbar cracked! It's useless now.
My hatchet is dull, I need a new one.
Damn, this hatchet is useless now!
I need a new hatchet.
If only I had some kind of shovel...
I could really use a shovel...
It's taking so long without a shovel...
Glad I have this shovel...
It's much easier with my shovel.
The shovel's doing a good job...
I hope I don't get caught stealing.
This belongs to someone else...
The sun's rising, I gotta move!
Not much time left! I must go back.
I've gotta leave this place fast.
I should get back.
Nothing here...
Nothing worth taking...
Empty pockets...
Just a dead body with nothing of value...
Nothing but useless trash...
Only trash and dirt here...
It's locked.
I need something to open this lock.
I could force the lock if only I had tools.
This door is locked.
It's locked, but my tools should do the trick.
I can force the lock open with my tools.
The lock's pretty simple, I should be able to open it.
The door is locked, but I have something that can take care of that.
It won't budge.
Something must be blocking it from the other side.
This door is boarded up.
It's barred from the other side.
It won't open.
Gotta try from the other side.
I can tear this down.
Some loose planks... I could easily remove them.
Simple barricade, I can dismantle it in a minute.
I could try and move the rubble...
The rubble's blocking the way. It'll take a while to pick through it.
I could make my way through this pile...
This door is grated. I need a saw blade to get through.
I won't breach this grate without a saw blade.
I could get through this door if I had a saw blade.

We've found a shelter.
War has driven us from our homes and took everything away. Fleeing the slaughter, we meet by chance, taking shelter in this battered building.
Many people living in the capital did not believe that the war would affect them. But it did. The military cut off the city from the outside world. Hunger and disease are widespread. There is no running water. Sniper bullets and mortar shells are a constant threat.</n></n>Marin lost everything in a fire. Arica fled to Pogoren following the massacre of her town, only to find the city besieged. Katia, who came here to report from the war zone, befriended them in the queue at the water pump. With nowhere to stay, they decided to make a ruined building their temporary home. They also took in Misha, a small boy who got separated from his parents in the chaos of the evacuation.
War has been raging for countless months and the besieged city has been reduced to a sea of ruins by constant shelling. Going outside during daylight is like inviting snipers to target practice. Everything is in short supply and what little aid reaches the city is seized by the most ruthless and best armed. </n></n>Few residents were lucky enough to flee. The unlucky ones, like Zlata, Cveta, Anton and Pavle, who missed the last refugee convoy, are left to fend for themselves. Ordinary people with no survival skills, huddling in the ruins, relying only on each other to survive.
War has been raging for countless months and the besieged city has been reduced to a sea of ruins by constant shelling. Going outside during daylight is like inviting snipers to target practice. Everything is in short supply and what little aid reaches the city is seized by the most ruthless and best armed. </n></n>Few residents were lucky enough to flee. The unlucky ones, who missed the last refugee convoy, are left to fend for themselves. Ordinary people, huddling in the ruins, relying only on each other to survive.
Surrounded in the capital by the government military, the rebels refuse to surrender. Caught in the middle of the fighting, with no running water or phones, struggling with lack of food and medications are civilians. In a civil war everyone is affected, one way or another. </n></n>Roman used to fight for the rebels, but he became disillusioned and ran away. Arica came to the capital fleeing persecutions in her home town. Bruno has been cut off by the siege from his home and his dearest friend. Homeless, on the run, and with nothing to lose but their lives, they band together to survive.
How long has this siege lasted? It's hard to say when every day is a struggle for survival. The city is crawling with snipers. Shelling is ordinary business almost every night. Phones don't work, there is a shortage of food and meds, and many people are left homeless.</n></n>Bruno and Marko have always been good friends, so when the war broke out they decided to stick together. They met Pavle while scavenging for supplies. He used to be Pogoren's star football player, now he's just another homeless victim of war, so they teamed up, hoping for the best.
When the civil war broke out, many people thought it would only last a couple of weeks. It's been years since government military surrounded the rebels in the capital, cutting off all supply lines. The civilian population trapped in the city are suffering from hunger, disease, and shelling. </n></n>Katia met both Pavle and Bruno before the war. She used to be a reporter, while Bruno had his own television cooking show. Pavle was the star of the local football team. Katia even interviewed him once. Now they meet in dramatically different circumstances, looking for food and shelter.
The night was calm, apart from the echo of distant shots. Let us hope it won't get worse.
The prolonged siege has turned many neighborhoods into mountains of rubble. Survivors fled to districts abandoned earlier by those who were lucky enough to have been evacuated. Huddled in partially collapsed houses full of holes, they are vulnerable to any attack - and this attracts the human vermin. </n></n>Anton and Cveta were friends back in high school, but their paths diverged after graduation. Reunited by fate after losing everything but their lives, they decide to stick together and hope that people who knew them before the war will help them survive this calamity.
This part of the besieged city has been spared from the worst destruction until recently, which attracts many homeless survivors from other neighborhoods. Smelling easy game, robbers descend on them in force to prey on their misery. </n></n>Fleeing from a thug, Katia has been saved by Roman, a former militia member. Later, her quick thinking and press badge saved them both when they stumbled upon an army picket. They decide to ride it out together despite severe differences in their views.
Affected by years of siege, the city of Pogoren is slowly dying. All the services except for electricity are gone and both food and water are scarce. Until recently, this neighborhood has been relatively intact and people still have some valuables on them. Unfortunately, this also attracts the gangs. </n></n>Firefighter Marko was fighting a losing battle with blazes until his fire station got destroyed and most of his team buddies perished. With his family safe in the countryside, he moved into an abandoned house to gather his wits and decide what to do next.
The army has surrounded the rebels in Pogoren and are now running a terror campaign, using indiscriminate shelling and sniper fire to break the defenders' will. The militias control most of the city, but in this neighborhood, full of refugees from other districts, gangs of robbers rule the streets.</n></n>Boris has lost everything that was dear to him and after being driven away by every single community he approached, came upon an abandoned house, full of holes. Figuring that a leaky roof over his head is better than no roof at all, he decided to hole up here for a while.
The misery brought by the endless siege has forced people to band together, but it has also broken up many small communities. The lonely survivors, bumping into each other by chance, often decide to ride out the war together regardless of the differences between them. </n></n>Roman was a frontline soldier, but having witnessed one execution too many, he deserted. Emilia, a lawyer, used to live with her father and sister in a posh villa. She's the only one left from her family. Content with each other's company, at least for now, they find a slightly less ruined house to hole up inside.
Months of incessant bombardment have turned this part of town into a sea of ruins. While most of the residents have fled to seek shelter in districts less exposed to sniper fire, the abandoned tenements attract those less fortunate, who have nowhere else to hide. </n></n>Marin lost everything in a fire that destroyed his workshop. Boris and Emilia once had families and now they are both the lone survivors. They come across a house that still offers some protection from the elements and decide to weather the siege together, inside its walls.
The relentless bombardment has reduced this part of the besieged city to ruins. Snipers hunt for survivors, making daytime trips in search of water and food a deadly game. The local community responded by pulling together with stubborn perseverance. Sadly, some people turned to stealing and worse.</n></n>Zlata, a student at the music academy, lost her parents. After the evacuation of her younger brother, she took Emilia, a lone survivor, under her wing. Together, they decided to shelter in an abandoned house and hope for the best. Despite their difficult situation, they agreed to look after a young girl named Kalina, while her older brother went to seek aid outside the city.
When the civil war broke out, many people thought it would only last a couple of weeks. It's been years since government military surrounded the rebels in the capital, cutting off all supply lines. Civilian population trapped in the city is suffering from hunger, disease, and shelling.</n></n>Katia met both Pavle and Marko before the war. She used to be a reporter, while Marko worked as a firefighter and they spoke briefly after a fire emergency. Pavle, star of the local football team, gave her an interview once. Now, they meet in dramatically different circumstances, looking for food and shelter.
Bastards! They can't treat us like this!
They told me my little girl would be fine if I worked hard.
The clients are repulsive swines!
I was told that I'd only have to dance...
Fucking animals. We've got to think of something...
Hold it right there stranger!
You're welcome if you've come to trade with us...
…but you're not allowed beyond this room.
So, what have you got there?
They took my food again...
Yeah, you can always count on friends...
Hey, stranger! Don't touch our box!
What do you want?
Stop! This school is held by Vyseni militia. We can trade...
...but you can't enter. What have you got?
Ok, now be on your way. Good night.
If you don't wanna trade, beat it.
...No, that wouldn't be right! We're not bandits!
Remember, we are to protect the people, not harm them!
Alright, I understand, don't worry.
Good. It's easy to forget that during the war...
Oh God, please help me...
God won't help you here.
And I'll gouge out your eyes if you don't shut up!
No! Please don't! Oh God...
All right, we got all the good stuff out.
Should last us a while. What about the next job?
I wouldn't mind hitting a humanitarian aid transport again.
Yeah, we'll fix'em good and proper.
Do you need more men?
No, the gate is secure.
... he is scavenging across the courtyard!
Bastard! What does he want from us?
I don't know, Bozena will shoot him on sight.
...and sneak quietly.
We'll get him from both sides?
Yes. Now move!
I didn't do anything wrong!
Broadcasting is forbidden. You're colluding with the rebels!
No! It's not my equipment.
Liar!
... but they say it will be over in a few days...
What will be over, my dear?
The war. We spoke about this, remember?
The war... We've lived through a war already.
Of course, honey, it was long ago. We met then, remember?
You were so handsome in your uniform! So many years...
... but I don't trust soldiers anymore. They bring nothing but trouble!
And you shouldn't, honey. They attacked the city, I told you...
We must save food, they've cut the rations...
Don't worry, my dear, I've already eaten.
You haven't honey, not today. Don't you remember?
Oh, you're right. I forget all the time...
I know, honey, I know...
Maybe we'll have a nice dinner tomorrow?
I don't feel so well, my dear... I'm so weak...
Could you make me supper and give me my pills...?
I can't, honey. Someone took most of our things yesterday...
Don't you remember? We were robbed last night.
Times like these bring out the worst in some people...
Indeed they do. Tomorrow I'll try to borrow some food from the neighbors.
You'd better do that. You look all pale and thin.
Just stay strong, my dear. Don't worry about me.
I hope no one will come tonight.
Why is that? You like visitors.
Not when they're acting strange, like the last one.
Was someone here? What did they want?
I don't know... A stranger was here, looking around.
Fortunately nothing important is missing.
People are so sad and confused lately, you know?
Perhaps you're right, my dear, but we don't need more visitors like this.
That's a pretty name for such a pretty face.
Thank you.
Looking for something?
Just some food...
Food? Poor girl. I can give you food for a favor.
Just come with me, babe. We'll dine and have some fun.
No, I'm afraid I can't...
The hell you can't!
If you don't want to starve, you have to do what I tell you!
I'm sorry, I have to go home...
There’s one more thing I really miss…
What? Fried chicken?
Naah, everyone misses fried chicken. For me it’s the music charts.
The charts? Like the top songs on the radio?
Yeah, all the goodness of the most recent music.
We used to bet the positions with my pal.
For money?
Sometimes. Recently we borrowed some old radio…
But the batteries died before the last 5 songs.
So much for our betting.
Screw the betting, I wanna know what’s popular with folks outside.
I personally don't care, unless it’s old school rock’n’roll again.
Yeah, you just need your chicken and rock’n’roll…
You know me.
You're coming with me!
Walk, you bitch, or I will shoot you.
^CharacterName^, what do you think about this place?
You know, proper home it ain't, but we're safe enough here...
The shelling have ruined the whole quarter.
Yeah, but let's hope they won't waste shells on ruins.
You think the artillery won't hit us?
You never know, but it's our best bet.
^CharacterName^, you think the snipers are still around?
Yeah, plenty of them in the city.
The military has been pushing really hard lately.
That's true, going out in the daylight is like playing Russian roulette.
Good thing we can get around at night.
It's much safer. These bastards still don't have the night scopes.
Quantity over quality...
You think it will be really over?
I don't know, ^CharacterName^, I hope so.
But it's getting harder each day, with even more shelling and fewer supplies...
The army wants to win the war before other countries get involved.
But so do the rebels.
If only they'd just leave us alone...
^CharacterName^...
Sorry, I'm busy...
Got a minute?
Can it wait? I'm doing something.
I heard that the siege will end soon.
I hope not. I know a rich place that hasn't been robbed yet.
So, maybe tomorrow?
I met a nice girl last night.
Did she give you head?
Yup!
We have to get some more water.
To make more moonshine?
To drink, fool.
Too bad our hostage died.
We should've given him some food.
Yeah, we'll have to remember to do this next time.
What about the ransom?
We'll still demand it, they don't know he's dead.
And after they've paid, we'll just give them the body?
Exactly.
The last one also died?
No, no one paid the ransom for him.
You killed him?
No, he fled.
How are you feeling, {mr|sir}{fr|ma'am}?
It's getting better.
I'm glad to hear that.
{mr|Sir}{fr|Ma'am}? is everything all right?
The pain subsided, but I'm worried that the hospital will take another bombing.
Try not to think about it. Just focus on getting better.
Good to see you, nurse.
Do you need something, {mr|sir}{fr|ma'am}?
Not really, I feel better just looking at you.
Oh, I'm glad you're in a good mood.
Welcome, we have been robbed recently, so we have little left...
My flock sleeps beneath the church. Please do not disturb them.
Hmm, there should be some ammo left here somewhere.
Ah, here it is!
Getting rid of that priest took more than I'd expected.
I think that's all. I'd better be going back.
Am I being followed?
Get a grip man, nobody's here.
Time for a cigarette break.
The wind is blowing this damn smoke from the church in our direction.
Why did those fools set it on fire? We're bound to get sick!
I tremble whenever I think of those bandits.
I hope they won't come back.
Ok, I'm out of here.
^CharacterName^, you can't give up!
It's hard, but we are in it together!
I... I know. But all this...
It's too much for me...
Yeah, things look grim...
...but I'm here for you if you need me.
Thank you. You're a good friend.
^CharacterName^... You know you're not alone in this.
Yeah... I just...
I don't think we'll make it.
If we are to make it...
...we must help each other, right?
...yeah.
This means we'll be needing you, ^CharacterName^.
Sorry. You're right.
I'll try to pull myself together.
Please, ^CharacterName^...
...don't give up.
It's so hard... to keep going...
I know. I know.
But we have to go on.
It's hopeless. But... I'll do what I can.
I know you're suffering, ^CharacterName^.
I'd do anything to help you.
Thank you. Pity you can't, eh?
I just... I really wish I could.
Sorry. And thank you. Really.
Now go away.
Hey ^CharacterName^, listen to me.
What do you want?
Just to remind you that you’re not alone here.
Go away…
No! I want to make it through, and I need your help...
...so stop crying and pull yourself together!
^CharacterName^, you look really sad.
You wanna talk?
No, I don’t.
Ok then, we can sit together in silence.
Oh come on, I don’t need your pity.
I’m not leaving you until you talk to me.
Hey ^CharacterName^, sorry to bother you…
…but you can’t just sit there and cry.
That’s none of your business.
I didn’t mean to offend you…
…but you mustn’t give up.
Don’t tell me what I must or mustn’t do!
Quit it! We have to help each other to survive!
^CharacterName^, I can see you’re down…
…but we need to work together to make it.
I doubt we’ll make it…
We won’t, if you don’t help. Come on! Get a grip!
I’ll try.
Trying’s not good enough.
Alright, stop pestering me already!
What do you want me to do?
It seems quite safe here...
We'd better stay inside during daylight.
Let's see if there's anything useful left here.
A few improvements and it can be livable.
Someone should search for supplies at night.
With proper tools we could build the stuff we need.
There's nothing more to tear down in the district, so the military lost interest.
People got nervous and suspicious. Better not provoke them.
I heard about aggressive groups wandering in this area.
The snipers can still be around.
There's never enough food, medication and bandages.
Simple disease will kill you in a few days without medicine.
There's plenty of materials around, we could build something useful.
Someone's at the door.
Was someone knocking?
I heard someone outside. Should we let him in?
There's someone waiting outside.
Oh, I see you're busy...
You're doing something? I won't bother you now.
You must've gone through a lot...
What can I do to help?
It's good not to be alone anymore.
I'm glad you invited me to stay.
I like what you did with this place.
I wonder how much longer this war will last.
You heard what the military did in Gravia?
I wonder who is worse... rebels, or the military?
We'd better avoid anyone armed, regardless who they are...
Will we be able to return to our normal lives after all this?
I'd love a cup of hot coffee...
Families torn apart by war... such a sad sight.
Hey! Can you help me?!
Hey, people! I need to talk to you!
Can you open the door, please? I have no bad intentions!
Hey, anybody there? I want to talk to you!
Let me in, please!
I'm just looking for shelter, have a heart!
At least hear me out!
Do you need an extra pair of hands here?
I can be useful, let me stay with you.
We have better chances together, can I stay?
Can I stay here with you? I have nowhere to go...
I have no home left... Maybe I could stay with you here?
Alright, I'm out of here.
If you think you're better off without me...
Maybe I'll have better luck elsewhere...
Suit yourself. I'm probably better off without you anyway.
You're leaving me out here to die...
You won't regret this!
Thank you! Together we can make it.
Good decision. Just tell me what to do.
You don't know how grateful I am.
Good to find some friendly people at last!
Please, make up your mind.
So, what will it be?
Have you decided yet?
Maybe you can think this through?
Come on, let me stay...
Please, I beg you...
Bloody hell... I barely made it... Oh, screw all this!
Oh, damn, it hurts so much... it's hell out there. Don't ask me...
Oh... Just... leave me alone...
I made it... help me, I'm barely standing...
I'm back... but I need help. It hurts...
Ah... damn, I can't take it anymore... help!
I made it with just a few scratches.
A few cuts and bruises couldn't have stopped me from getting back to you.
Oh, it's good to be back... I'm a bit battered, but it could've been worse.
Hi, I'm back! And in one piece, if a bit tired.
I made it without a single scratch!
It's good to be back alive and well!
Here, the bandages... Don't ask me.
I've got the bandages... I... don't want to talk about it.
I brought the bandages. Now leave me alone.
I have the meds... You don't want to know what it took to get them.
Here, your meds. I hope they are worth it...
I made it, I brought the meds... and just leave it at that.
I've got the bandages... and now I'm gonna need them too.
I made it, I got the bandages! And I need them too, isn't luck a bitch?
I've got the bandages! Ow. Sorry, it looks like I could use some, too.
Hey, I got the meds!... But I need some bandages to stop the bleeding.
Here, I brought some meds. Now if you excuse me, I need to have this wound dressed…
Ow. I've got the meds, but I also got roughed up... more than a bit.
Sorry, I haven't found anything useful... I really tried.
I got nothing. I'm so sorry to disappoint you...
Sorry, no luck tonight. I'll look harder next time.
I'm back, and I have the bandages!
Look, I've got the bandages! Let's dress that wound...
I brought the bandages! Now let's see to that wound...
Look, I brought some meds!
I'm back, and I've got the meds!
I got the medicine. I hope it'll help...
Hey, I brought some food!
Who ordered carryout? Here you go!
Hi, I got us some chow!
Hi, I'm back! And let me tell you, it's not all doom and gloom out there!
Home sweet home! You know, sometimes I think the world hasn't gone to hell after all.
I'm back! I'd never thought I'd say so, but I really wish you all had gone with me tonight!
Oh, my back. But look at all the stuff I brought!
I found lots of useful things. Ah, it feels so good to finally stretch out!
Ouch, I feel like a pack animal. Let's put the stuff I've found to good use!
Tonight I had a really good haul. Look what I got!
I found plenty of really fine stuff. What a night!
Hello! Look at all this stuff! I wish I could bring so much every night.
This was one lucky night, you won't believe what I've found!
I've struck gold tonight, look what I brought!
I'm back and I feel like Santa. Just look at that!
This should wake me up.
I love the smell of coffee in the morning.
I'm glad we've got coffee.
I wish I had some coffee.
Damn it! No coffee for me.
Too bad there's no coffee.
A smoke calms me down.
This smoke is what I need.
At least we've got some cigarettes.
Where are my cigarettes?
Damn it, there are no smokes left.
Too bad we've run out of cigarettes.
Who's gonna drink with me?
I'm... I'm dizzy...
... And she's... a stairway to... hell...
We're invincible, I tell you! We just need to worry less.
Somewhere... over... the rainbow... painted black...
You're my best friends... lemme give you a hug!
I was thinking about this... and I don't know what to think...
I'll kill those snipers myself!
Come here and get me!
Retribution will come, you'll see! Just you wait!
Nope, I'm not in the mood for that.
I'd rather go back to that bottle.
Surely there's something more interesting to do.
Honestly... I'm just too wasted.
Thank you!
That is very kind of you!
Thanks a lot!
Here you are!
I hope this will help!
Sure, take this!
Let's go!
Let's not waste time!
Lead the way!
I can't help you, sorry.
You have to look for help elsewhere, sorry.
I'm really sorry...
Come back later, I'll see what I can do.
Give me some time, I'll try to help you.
Come again in a couple of days, maybe then I can help.

I'm hungry.
My stomach is rumbling.
I'd gladly eat something.
We need food.
I'm so hungry.
I haven't eaten for days.
We need to find food!
I could eat anything...
I'm terribly hungry!
I'm starving... I must eat something...
I must eat, I'm getting weaker.
I've been starving for too long.
I need something to eat... anything...
I'm starving... so hungry...
Everything's blurry... I'm so hungry...
Something to eat... please...
I'm finally full.
If I eat more, I'll burst!
What a feast!
It's good to eat well once in a while.

It hurts, but I'll manage.
It's just a scratch.
I'm bleeding, but just a little.
It's just a flesh wound, but it hurts.
I could do with some bandages.
They hit me hard.
If I don't dress this wound, it can get worse.
I'm bleeding.
I need to take care of this wound.
It hurts like hell.
I'm bleeding fast!...
I'm losing too much blood. I need help.
The wound's getting worse. Hurts a lot.
I'm a bleeding mess...
Blood everywhere... I won't make it...
So much blood... Am I going to die?
I'm barely breathing... Is this the end?
Can't stand this pain...
The pain... help me, please...
No... the pain's unbearable...
Now it should heal.
I'll have to replace these bandages, soon.
I got wounded...
Damn, it hurts!
If this keeps up, I'll bleed to death.
My wounds are killing me, I have to rest in bed.
It hurts, I'll go to bed for a while.
I have to lie down for a moment or my wounds will open.
It's not very comfy but at least it hurts less.
It could be worse, at least I have a bed to rest in.
It would be easier to bear this pain if someone was holding my hand.
These wounds are killing me, I have to sit down.
I'll sit down for a moment, my wounds hurt.
Let me sit down for a moment, my wounds hurt.
My wounds hurt, I'd rather lie down in bed for a while.
It's better than standing, but a bed would be even better.
It could be worse. At least I have a chair to sit on.
My wounds are killing me, I have to lie down on the floor.
I'll lie down for a moment somewhere.
Let me lie down somewhere for a while, my wounds hurt.
The floor is so cold. A bed would be so much better.
The floor is no good, I need a proper bed.
I wish I had a proper bed.
I feel ill, I hope it's nothing serious.
I don't feel so well, I think I have shivers.
I don't feel too well, I think I have a fever.
I've got a nasty headache.
I am feeling lousy. And it's getting worse.
This fever... I feel terrible...
I think I'm running a fever. Gotta get some meds.
I'll get worse if I don't get some medicine.
My throat is burning.
My head is killing me.
I've been ill for too long... I'm so weak.
I'm all dizzy... barely standing.
My throat burns, my entire body tingles.
If I don't get a cure, I'm done.
So cold... the pain... I need a doctor.
This illness... I don't think I'm gonna make it.
I'm all sore... so numb...
Please... call the doctor...
This goddamn disease... Not like this. Not like this...

I feel ill, I have to rest in bed.
I think I have a fever, I'd better hit the bed.
I feel so weak, I'd better lie in bed for a while.
It's not very comfy, but at least I feel warmer.
That's a little better. I wish my mother were here.
I've slept in better beds, but this one should do in a pinch.
I feel weak, I have to sit down.
I wish we had proper beds, and maybe some hot broth.
I can't let this illness get the better of me.
I need to lie down on a bed, I have shivers.
I'm so weak, I need to rest in bed for a while.
I have to overcome this illness, there are still things to do.
I haven't slept in some time.
I could use some rest...
I should sleep off the last night.
Too many sleepless nights.
It's hard to work without rest.
I need some rest.
I'm so worn out. If I don't get some sleep...
I'm too tired... I might fall asleep any moment now.
I'm all numb and drowsy. It's becoming unbearable...
I'll just lie down for a minute... Too tired...
Rest... Just a little bit of rest...
I feel dizzy and weak... Need some rest now...
Sleeping on the floor is terrible.
I'd love a good night's sleep in a proper bed.
I slept restlessly most of the time.
My back hurts from sleeping on the floor.
At least it's warm.
We're lucky it's not cold in here.
I hope we'll manage to keep it warm in here.
It's getting cold.
It's easier to fall ill when it's so cold.
It's rather chilly inside. We should think about heating.
It's too cold in here!
I'm frozen to the bones. We must get some heating quickly.
You're bound to get a cold in this damn chill.
Not a bad day.
We're gonna make it.
Things will work out, eventually.
At least there's some relief.
Good, good. Let's just keep it that way!
I'm sure this day will bring some good news!
Soon it will be over. We'll be fine!
At last something good happened!
Not a good day...
Let's not lose hope...
It's getting worse day by day.
I wish I had left the city... Damn!
It's all getting too hard...
I can't... I give up.
This will never end...
All this... I can't handle it anymore.
I've had enough... I can't take it anymore!
Screw this...
What good will it do?...
There is no point anyway...
We would be better off dead...
I wish I had never been born!
I can't take it anymore... I just can't...
Please, I want to wake up from this nightmare...
I'd rather be dead than live another day of this hell...
I miss ^CharacterName^.
How will we cope without ^CharacterName^?
I can't believe {mr|he}{fr|she}'s gone...
^CharacterName^... How I wish you were still with us...
^CharacterName^... oh, ^CharacterName^!
Why did {mr|he}{fr|she} have to die?!
I can't believe ^CharacterName^ was killed...
They killed ^CharacterName^ like a dog...
I can't believe it... yesterday {mr|he}{fr|she} was with us and now...
To kill like that... What a waste of life...
I can't stop thinking about how ^CharacterName^ was killed. Soon they'll kill us all...
I can't get over {mr|his}{fr|her} death... Who will be next?
They killed ^CharacterName^…Will they kill us all?
Why did they have to kill ^CharacterName^?... Such a terrible waste of life...
I did what I did. We have to be strong or we'll all die, too.
This could happen to any of us. It's war.
It wasn't supposed to end like that... I can't get over it.
Those frightened eyes...
It's war, but... did it have to happen?
Did I have a choice? I can't stop thinking about it...
I can't believe I killed like that...
So much death... everywhere...
... That's too much for me ...
Damn! ... I can't stop thinking about what I did...
If ^CharacterName^ killed someone, it must have been for our good.
^CharacterName^ made a hard choice... but it's us or them all the time.
^CharacterName^ killed someone... damn...
^CharacterName^! Why...?
Someone died... because of us.
I don't want to think about it...
We better keep an eye on ^CharacterName^…
Why?! Why are we doing this?...
I can't stop thinking about what ^CharacterName^ did...
No more blood! ... No more!!!
It's us or them, it could have been me lying there.
I can't undo what I did. We can grieve after the war, but first we have to survive it.
I wish I could undo this... but what choice did I have?
I can't believe I did it... It all went so quickly...
I wish I hadn't gone there... but I went... and I killed...
Will I kill someone next time? I hope this all ends soon, one way or the other...
When will this shit end?... I won't have another death on me...
Oh, bloody hell... This death was the last straw, I'm done...
^CharacterName^ did what {mr|he}{fr|she} had to. It's war.
I'm sure ^CharacterName^ wouldn't have killed anybody if there had been a way to avoid it.
Oh, ^CharacterName^... Why did you have to do this?...
If we survive, ^CharacterName^ will never forget this...
I wish we didn't have to do this...
All this killing... Is it ever going to end?
Do we really have to kill?! Is there no other way?
Another death... And for what? For what?
Bloody thugs... there's one less to worry about.
Bandit scum... they would kill me like a dog, but not this time!
I had to defend myself... but I hate what I was forced to do.
It was a close call... I could've died, too...
I wish we wouldn't have to kill to survive.
I wonder how many people he killed... I can't become like him.
Damn it! Damn them all to hell! Why can't they just let us live?...
Bloody murderers! I can't stand it any longer...
Well done, ^CharacterName^. One bastard less.
^CharacterName^ did well. Those murderers have no mercy.
^CharacterName^ had no choice... but I wish we had.
These thugs brought it upon themselves... but I feel for ^CharacterName^ anyway.
It's a vicious circle... They murder people, and now ^CharacterName^ killed one of them...
There is already so much death everywhere... and now this...
I can't believe my luck. He was a trained killer... and I won!
He brought the war to our city, and now he's dead.
Poor bastard... I wonder if he was drafted...
I can't stop thinking about the letter his mother will get...
He was an ordinary guy... just like us...
I bet he didn't want to be here as much as we don't...
Good, I wish we could get back at the snipers as well.
^CharacterName^ is amazing. One murderer less!
The government is turning us against each other...
Sending the army against your own people is a crime... but this guy had no say in it.
What did this poor bastard do to deserve this?! He was under orders!
Why did ^CharacterName^ have to do this?! They didn't ask to be here!
I'm sure ^CharacterName^ will be fine.
I'm sure ^CharacterName^ will be all right, this wound is nothing to worry about.
^CharacterName^ needs to get this wound dressed.
I'm worried about ^CharacterName^.
Look at ^CharacterName^. {mr|His}{fr|Her} wound doesn't look good.
It's too damn easy to get wounded.
^CharacterName^... What did they do to {mr|him}{fr|her}...?
I wish we could help ^CharacterName^...
Damn it, we can't lose {mr|him}{fr|her}...
^CharacterName^ has lost so much blood...
I feel much better today. I'll be fine.
Bandages did the job.
I feel fine at last.
The wound finally healed.
^CharacterName^ looks better today.
Good we had the bandages for {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Seems that ^CharacterName^ has recovered.
I'm so glad ^CharacterName^ feels better.
I'll be fine, it's just a small cough.
A good night's sleep, some pills and I'll be all right.
It's the most unfortunate time to fall ill…
Before the war, I'd have been fine in a day or two…
I won't get better without medicines.
Damn it, I'm not getting better at all.
I'm sick all the time... It's too much for me, I won't get well...
I fear this will not end well for me...
I hate being ill. I'm afraid I'm getting worse…
I won't see the end of war...
I'm sure ^CharacterName^ can cope with a small cough.
It's just a cold, {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll be all right.
^CharacterName^ doesn't look well. I wish I could just call an ambulance...
I'm afraid ^CharacterName^ isn't getting any better...
I'm worried about ^CharacterName^, just look at {mr|him}{fr|her}...
I wish ^CharacterName^ got better... I fear the worst.
We can't beat this illness... Soon all will be over...
It's hopeless... Without help, we can just wish for a quick end...
I fear that ^CharacterName^ won't make it...
^CharacterName^ isn't going to pull through...
I feel much better today. I'll be fine.
The meds did the job.
I feel fine at last.
I'm finally in good health!
^CharacterName^ looks better today.
Good we had the meds for {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Seems that ^CharacterName^ has recovered.
I'm so glad ^CharacterName^ feels better.
We're safe here, no one can do us harm when we're inside.
As long as we remain alert, they can't hurt us here.
We managed to fend off the attack, but what if the next one is stronger?
We drove the thugs away last time, but we won't hold them back forever...
We need to be on guard. I'm afraid the bandits are just testing our defenses.
I'm afraid we just lucked out with the last attack. What if the next gang is stronger?
Sooner or later the bandits will break through. What will they do to us then?
We can't keep them away forever… It's only a matter of time.
This time we managed to drive them off, but in the long run we stand no chance...
It's pure luck they broke off the attack. I fear that the next one will bring on our end...
It's good we can guard this place against aggressors.
The bandits can be fought off! Just keep alert!
That was close. They bring more people, and we're toast!
The bandits know we're here. They'll come back in force.
If they keep hitting us, they'll eventually wear us down...
I fear we won't recover before the next attack...
Next time they'll break through... It's pointless...
We won, but at what cost? This can't go on much longer...
This can't go on like that. They'll kill us all in the end...
Another attack like that and we're done for...
The bandits are dangerous, but we can deal with them!
The bandits can be driven away if we keep guard.
I'm afraid we won't survive the next attack...
We barely survived this time. What are we going to do we do if they return?
Attacks like that will grind us down soon, I'm afraid...
Bandits will finish us if we don't do something about it...
We'll all die... Next time the aggressors come, we're dead...
We have no chance... We can't stop the bandits from doing whatever they want…
Bloody thugs... one by one, they'll finish us all...
Next time they'll take all our stuff... and our lives...
These supplies are vital to us. I had to take them.
I only took what we needed the most.
Stealing is wrong, but what was I supposed to do?
I feel bad about it, but I had to take those things.
How wretched can we get... We must steal to survive...
If only we could do without stealing... But we can't...
^CharacterName^ brought some needed goods. Yes, he stole them… so what?
Sometimes you just have to steal to survive.
I'd rather ^CharacterName^ didn't steal, but we need supplies.
^CharacterName^ brought some stolen goods. I hope those people won't need them.
It seems the war has turned us into thieves...
Not only are we poor, now we're also foul...
I had to steal these things, they'll help us...
Without these goods we would not survive, I had to take them.
Poor people, I feel bad about taking their things...
Maybe I shouldn't have stolen those things...
I hope those people will be alright, they needed these things as much as we did.
Stealing from other poor people... What have I become?
If ^CharacterName^ hadn't taken those things, soldiers or looters would...
I pity those people, but we needed supplies...
I know we need supplies, but stealing?... That's just wrong.
How miserable can you become? Stealing to survive...
^CharacterName^ should've left those people more supplies, they are in need, too!
Seems we're no better than looters...
I'm sorry for those people, but I had no choice.
Those poor people will have a hard time now.
With so little left, those people might not survive...
I feel bad about taking those things. How are they gonna survive now?
I left those people with virtually nothing… They won't last for long...
What have I done... Without the things I took they will surely die...
We're no better than looters...
I don't think resorting to robbery was necessary...
Is robbery the only way to get what we need?!
How could ^CharacterName^ leave those people with almost nothing...
Are we really so desperate that we need to rob people blind?!
That was cruel of ^CharacterName^ to leave those people with nothing...
I couldn't sleep all night... I feel terrible...
How can I sleep with all my worst fears racing through my head?
I need sleep. Yet, whenever I close my eyes, the worst things I saw come back to haunt me.
I couldn't fall asleep, I couldn't stop thinking...
It will be harder without ^CharacterName^ around.
^CharacterName^ left us. Are we that bad?
Could we have done anything to make ^CharacterName^ stay?
^CharacterName^ lost hope that we could survive here... What if {mr|he}{fr|she} was right?
We can't keep quarreling like that, we need to help each other.
It's hard even without ^CharacterName^ arguing about everything.
If we can't reach an agreement, we won't survive...
That row last night was terrible...
Why did {mr|he}{fr|she} do it? There still was some hope...
It was terrible to find out that ^CharacterName^ had killed {mr|himself}{fr|herself}!
Is suicide our only way out of this hell?
^CharacterName^ couldn't take it anymore... Are we stronger?
It was heartbreaking to listen to ^CharacterName^ cry all night...
Something is really wrong with ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} sobbed violently all night.
I was unable to make {mr|him}{fr|her} stop crying...
Seems that ^CharacterName^ is suffering from a breakdown...
^CharacterName^ got into a fight with me last night...
^CharacterName^ beat me last night. How could {mr|he}{fr|she}?
^CharacterName^ was angry last night and started beating me...
How are we to fight the odds if we fight each other?
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ is back. I was so worried.
^CharacterName^ made it back. It's good to see {mr|him}{fr|her} again.
We need ^CharacterName^, it's good {mr|he}{fr|she}'s back.
I don't know what we'd do If we lost ^CharacterName^.
This time ^CharacterName^ made it back despite the risk.
^CharacterName^ could've got killed... what was {mr|he}{fr|she} thinking?
I thought ^CharacterName^ wouldn't make it back.
Damn, it's been several days since I last smoked.
A cigarette would make me feel better.
When was the last time I smoked?
It's been so long since I last had a cigarette.
Seems the deal I made in the garage will help these people.
The deal I made in the garage should benefit these people as well.
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ helped the people in the garage.
It's good when we can help each other a little, like ^CharacterName^ with those folks from the garage.
I can't stop thinking about what happened in the garage...
The folks at the garage will manage somehow... won't they?
I wish I hadn't had to steal from the garage...
Those guys at the garage... I'll make it up to them after the war... somehow...
^CharacterName^ took a lot from those men at the garage...
^CharacterName^ cleaned out the garage... left them with almost nothing...
It's such a shame what ^CharacterName^ did at the garage... but what can we do?...
It's too bad that ^CharacterName^ stole from the garage owner... but we needed that stuff!
That starving man will surely be fine now. For a couple of days at least.
I'm glad I shared food with that hungry man.
Sharing food with that man was the least I could do.
I admire what ^CharacterName^ did in the squat.
I admire ^CharacterName^'s compassion towards that hungry man.
^CharacterName^ did the right thing. We need to help other people.
That homeless man... What could I do? We're all hungry...
That starving guy... I wish we had enough to share...
That hungry man I met... I can't get over it...
I can't forget this homeless man... I wonder if he'll live...
The man that ^CharacterName^ met... What will become of him...?
I fear that this starving man ^CharacterName^ met won't make it through the winter...
^CharacterName^ met this homeless guy... and just left him to die...?
This starving man ^CharacterName^ met... but we are hungry, too...
I don't know how, but I did it. I helped someone in that brothel.
The brothel is still there but at least I saved someone.
I don't know if ^CharacterName^ is insanely brave or just insane.
This city is not owned by gangs!
What transpired in the brothel... I'm impressed.
I don't know where I found that courage.
That guy I helped looked terrible, but he should be better by now.
^CharacterName^ stood up against criminals. Well, that's admirable.
Damn psychos. Fortunately, ^CharacterName^ was able to release that man.
I made sure they'll never hurt anybody.
By killing those two soldiers I saved many lives.
Those snipers got what they deserved.
The streets are a little bit safer with those two snipers gone.
It was a pretty good loot at that old couple's house.
I brought a lot of stuff from that old couple's house.
I keep thinking about that old man and his wife.
I didn't leave much for those old people...
That old woman didn't seem well. Will she be alright?
What will happen to those people now...?
That old man and his wife... I can't stop thinking about what happened there...
Robbing that old couple was the last straw... Can't do this anymore.
If that woman dies... Her husband won't survive it...
We're all ruthless robbers now... There's no point in pretending we're not...
^CharacterName^ brought some good stuff from that last house.
Are we robbing pensioners now...?
Those people ^CharacterName^ robbed...
^CharacterName^ took a lot from this old couple...
Things are now even tougher for the old people.
^CharacterName^ robbed an elderly couple... What's become of us?
That old couple... How will they survive...?
We rob people blind. The war took away our dignity.
We're all bandits now. I'm sick and tired of it.
That elderly couple I met... it's really amazing how they endure.
That elderly couple I met... I hope they'll manage.
Amazing that this elderly couple is still holding out in their house on their own.
Old people die, and these times are especially hard on them.
That old man and his wife... Is it my fault?
These old folks... What a bloody shame...
People die all the time... the elderly are just first to go.
Those pensioners wouldn't have to die in the time of peace...
Those dead people ^CharacterName^ saw... What happened to them?
Those elderly people had such a nice house, and now they're dead...
That elderly couple ^CharacterName^ saw... Are we the cause of their demise?
These old folks... what a waste of life...
That girl was so scared...
The soldiers can't just do whatever they please!
Why did I go to that damn shop!
Could someone have helped that girl?
That poor girl... She must've been so frightened...
Military scumbags... Let them all die and rot.
What happened in that store... I wish I hadn't gone there...
Someone should have helped... No one cares anymore...
The girl that ^CharacterName^ told about... Poor thing...
The military are getting even more depraved.
Maybe ^CharacterName^ shouldn't have gone there?
Could ^CharacterName^ have helped her somehow?
Every night I hear someone is hurt in this damn city...
The military is here to torment us...
^CharacterName^... Why did you go to that store...
^CharacterName^... Couldn't you do anything...?
That girl should be safe now. What a relief.
These army goons will not push us around!
Good I came in the right moment to stop that soldier.
To save someone's life... It feels good.
^CharacterName^ has courage.
I can't believe ^CharacterName^ stood up against the military.
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ went to that shop.
That girl should be grateful to ^CharacterName^.
I wonder what happened to that wounded man...
I should've helped that wounded man...
Poor guy... and I left him there...
I left him to die... What will happen to his son...?
Without my help he probably didn't make it...
I should've done something...
The story ^CharacterName^ told only confirms how dangerous the snipers are.
^CharacterName^ should've done something to help that man...
If it had been me instead of ^CharacterName^ there, would I have helped?
The snipers will take us down one by one. It's only a matter of time.
Chances are we'll all end up like that man.
If that man died, his child most likely won't make it, either.
I'm so relieved that man managed to reach his baby.
I'm glad I was able to help that wounded man.
We have to help each other whenever we can.
What happened at the Sniper Junction could've ended much worse.
^CharacterName^ did the right thing.
I was so relieved when I heard that ^CharacterName^ helped that man.
Poor guy... That sniper must've finished the job.
Poor man... No one should die bleeding alone in the street.
I could've ended up like that poor man...
Another victim of the Sniper Junction...
How many more lives will the sniper bullets take?
Will the killing ever stop?
I feel sorry for the patients, but I had no choice.
The hospital will have a hard time now.
Without medicines and bandages, those people might not survive...
I feel bad about stealing from the hospital, what will happen to the patients?
That doctor did so much for the hospital... And I ruined it all...
What have I done... Patients in that hospital may die because of me...
So now we're stealing from the sick and wounded.
I don't think robbing the hospital was a necessary thing.
Robbing the hospital... Wasn't there no other way?
How could ^CharacterName^ take supplies from the hospital!
Stealing from the hospital... What's worse than that?!
^CharacterName^ taking medicines and bandages... That was so low...
The doctor will save more lives thanks to my help.
The hospital can't surrender! Its patients can count on us.
I hope things I traded with the doctor are going to save someone's life.
We don't have much, but we can still help other people.
I helped the hospital... but what are we gonna do now?
We've given away medical supplies and they are so hard to come by...
I'd do the same as ^CharacterName^.
If we all pull together, the hospital will not fall!
Donating supplies is a good idea unless we need them.
It's good to help, but maybe it wasn't the best moment to do so.
Yeah, the patients will survive... We won't, though.
The people in the hospital stand better chances than we do...
^CharacterName^ is very ill... We'd better dig a grave while we still have some strength left.
We are so miserable, we can't even help ^CharacterName^ fight the illness.
I feel so powerless... ^CharacterName^ is very ill and I can only sit and watch... Can we get the meds in time?
I'm afraid ^CharacterName^ might not make it, and I can't do anything about it.
^CharacterName^ is very ill. I'm really worried we could contract this disease.
I hope we don't get this disease from ^CharacterName^. It's bad enough with {mr|him}{fr|her} being ill.
^CharacterName^ is very ill. We have to get {mr|him}{fr|her} medicine somehow. If we can't buy it, maybe we could steal it.
^CharacterName^ won't make it unless we get our hands on some meds.
^CharacterName^ is getting worse and most likely won't pull through. Too bad we can't help {mr|him}{fr|her}.
If we don't secure more meds, we will eventually all succumb to illness like ^CharacterName^.
I'm worried about ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} is getting worse. We need to find some meds real soon.
We have to take care of each other! We must get the meds for ^CharacterName^ quickly.
Damn... I'm so ill... I need meds, and I need them now... Who the fuck took the last dose?!
I need meds... I don't care how you get them, just get them!
The illness is getting worse all the time... I desperately need meds... I need them more than anyone else...
You have to get me some meds... buy them, steal them, I don't care as long as I get them...
I'm so ill... This fever is killing me... I desperately need meds...
I'm dying from this disease... you can't let me die... you can't...
I'm very ill... I think this is it... I'll die without meds...
I'm so ill... can you get me some meds? You need me...
I feel terrible... If we don't find some meds, I will die...
You must get me some meds or I'll die... Don't let it happen... please...
I feel so sick... I don't know if I'm gonna make it...
This might be it, my friends... Promise me you'll hang on even if I don't make it...
Why is it that others have so much while we have so little?! They should share, or else!
Those bastards wouldn't share with us, I had to do it.
We need supplies, I couldn't let them stand in our way.
I'm gonna make it whatever it takes.
Luckily I wasn't caught. I can still hear my heart pounding.
That was close. Luckily, I made it.
We are no different from others. We do what we have to in order to survive.
We have to steal to survive. It's war.
I know it was wrong, but how else are we to survive?
Does it matter how we get supplies? The important thing is that we're alive.
The fate of those men is not our concern. What's important is that we've got supplies.
I care about my own, those men's fate is not my problem.
It appalls me to see what I have to do so that we can make it.
How long can we go on robbing people like that before we get caught?
What I had to do was appalling, but it's either them or us.
I did what had to be done. Gotta take care of my own.
We hurt others to get what we need... Are we no better than bandits?
Is robbing people really the only way to survive? If so, we've lost our souls.
I feel terrible about robbing those men...
I can't believe I robbed those men... What was I thinking?
Poor father and son... ^CharacterName^ shouldn't have stolen from them.
Why did ^CharacterName^ do it? Wasn't there any other way?
I can't blame ^CharacterName^ for stealing from the garage. I'd have done the same.
Will they be able to replace what ^CharacterName^ took from them?
The men from the garage have it as hard as we do, I feel bad that ^CharacterName^ stole from them.
That was a good trade, we helped each other out.
I'm glad we could trade with those men. We could do it again.
I'm so glad I could help that man's father.
It's good to know that despite the hardships we can still help other people!
I saw those old people dead. Fuck this war.
Fuck this war! It forces us to do such hideous things.
Old people die all the time, it is no different in war.
Those old people wouldn't have made it, even if we hadn't paid them a visit.
Those old people are both dead. Still, better that it happened to them than to us.
Those old people were defenseless. We must make sure we're not, if we don't want to end up like them.
The old couple are dead. If we hadn't taken their things, someone else would.
Those elderly people would've died anyway, their supplies serve us better.
That poor elderly couple didn't make it and it's all our fault.
If not for us, those old people might still be alive. I'm ashamed, but how are we to survive without food and medications?
They're dead, we're alive. Better than the other way around. They were old anyway.
We care about our own. The family of those elderly people should've taken better care about them.
I saw the bodies of those old people. Seems their family did not care about them after all.
I hope we don't end up like those elderly people. Would anyone miss us?
We could've shown mercy to those old people. We didn't and now they're dead.
We caused the death of those elderly people. But if it's a choice between some stranger's life and your friend's...
Our actions led to the death of those elderly people. What excuse have we got?
We're the reason those old people are dead. We're despicable.
We're responsible for the death of that elderly couple. We're disgusting.
How low can we get... It's because of us that those elderly people are dead.
Those old people are dead. We are to blame.
Robbing defenseless elderly people... We don't deserve to survive.
If it hadn't been for us, that elderly couple would still be alive.
I feel bad about those elderly people. They died because of us.
If we hadn't visited those old people, it could be us lying dead right now.
Those old people could not defend themselves against us. Can we defend ourselves against other looters?
We should stick together to weather this storm rather than hurt others and steal from them.
If this siege continues, everyone will die of hunger and disease, or we'll just kill each other fighting over scraps that are left.
They were old anyway, we needed these things more than they did.
I had no choice, I had to take their things. How else are we to survive?
They are old and probably won't live long anyway. Their things will help us.
I had to take those things, those people's family should take care about them. We only have ourselves.
I don't want to talk about how I got these supplies.
Don't ask me how I got these things. Just be glad we have them.
I know it's wrong, but I had to take what we need. Otherwise we'd have no chance.
I'm not proud of it, but I had to steal from those poor people. We are in dire need of supplies.
That elderly couple... I don't think they'll make it without the supplies I took.
Poor old people... I'd never have done it if we weren't so desperate.
Those old people have so many things, even food and meds, while we have so little. Don't blame me I took some.
Those elderly people have a family that supports them. They'll be fine.
What ^CharacterName^ did was very cruel. I hope those old people will be ok.
Poor old people... I can't stop imagining my parents in their situation...
I don't care where and how ^CharacterName^ got supplies. I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't return empty-handed.
I don't think stealing from that old couple was necessary. Surely there are other ways to get what we need.
I hope those elderly people have some family to support them. We shouldn't steal from them anymore.
We haven't got much but we can't turn a blind eye to suffering.
I shared some food with a hungry man. Despite having so little, we need to remain human.
I gave food to a starving man. It wouldn't help us anyway.
We have little food, but I just had to share it with that poor man.
^CharacterName^ shared our food with a starving man. We probably won't make it through anyway.
I wonder if that hungry man has better chances than we do.
^CharacterName^ did the right thing.
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ helped that poor man.
Poor guy, I understand why ^CharacterName^ just couldn't refuse to share some food with him.
I know supplies are tight, but ^CharacterName^ did the right thing by sharing food with that man from the squat.
Poor man, I hope we don't end up in a situation like his.
I couldn't share food with that man. We have so little ourselves, and it probably wouldn't have made much difference anyway.
Food is so hard to come by. We don't have enough to share with anyone.
Poor guy. If only I could spare some food, I would have. But I have to think about the others.
If the siege lasts any longer, everyone will begin starving.
Death of hunger must be horrible, I hope that man from the squat can manage somehow.
If we start handing out our food to anyone who asks, we won't make it through.
We are so miserable we couldn't even help that hungry man.
Poor starving man. More and more people will begin starving soon.
I hope that man from the squat is ok. Maybe we should bring him some food?
That starving man from the squat was just one of hundreds who are trapped in the city.
We need to stick together and help each other, otherwise we might share the fate of that man from the squat.
We must make sure we don't end up like that poor man from the squat.
Damn those soldiers! They think they can do whatever they want! Fucking criminals!
I saw a soldier abusing a girl... We had better avoid those pigs.
What happened to that girl was terrible but that soldier would have hurt me worse, had I interfered.
What happened to that girl happens every day in wartime. If I'd tried to help her, that soldier would've killed me.
I feel sorry for that girl... but what was I supposed to do?
I saw a soldier abusing some poor girl. I'm just glad it wasn't anyone I know.
That soldier was so cruel to that girl... And I was too powerless to stop him.
That pig took advantage of a defenseless girl but I couldn't stop him... It would've put us all in danger if I had.
I couldn't help that girl. I couldn't do anything. I felt so powerless.
What that soldier did to that poor girl... how can anyone be so cruel? If only I was strong enough to save her...
There was nothing ^CharacterName^ could do to save that girl.
It's so sad that ^CharacterName^ couldn't save that girl.
What that soldier did to that poor girl... how can anyone be so cruel? If only ^CharacterName^ had helped her...
Poor girl... I can't stop thinking about what happened to her...
I pity that girl... but that soldier would have done much worse to ^CharacterName^, had {mr|he}{fr|she} interfered.
Poor girl... We should avoid those cruel military scumbags.
^CharacterName^ couldn't risk helping that girl, he would've put us all in danger.
Where were that girl's friends? Or family? ^CharacterName^ wasn't obliged to save her.
That soldier was so cruel to that girl... And ^CharacterName^ was too powerless to stop him.
The military are so cruel... we have to make sure we're able to defend ourselves against them.
Poor, defenseless girl, abused by that monster... but if ^CharacterName^ had tried to stop him, we could have all been in danger.
That unfortunate girl... I can't imagine something like that happen to my sister, daughter, or friend.
I can understand why ^CharacterName^ did not help that girl. It was too dangerous.
What could have ^CharacterName^ done against that soldier? They're trained killers!
Bastards think they can do anything they want! Glad I was there to save that girl.
Saving that girl was so risky, I could've got killed. What was I thinking?
My hands are still trembling. That soldier could've killed me but I did the right thing.
I helped that girl. She should be grateful I was there.
I saved that girl. Would anyone do the same for one of us, I wonder?
I sure hope helping that girl did not put us in danger. We have enough problems already.
I don't want to imagine what would have happened had I not saved that girl.
I'm glad I saved that girl. How can the military do such things?
I saved that girl... but how many more are less fortunate every night of this war?
I'm so glad I managed to save that girl. I hope the poor thing is alright.
^CharacterName^ managed to save that girl... but how many are less fortunate every night of this war?
^CharacterName^ saved that girl... this time.
I'm so glad ^CharacterName^ managed to save that girl. I hope the poor thing is alright.
I don't want to think what would've happened if ^CharacterName^ hadn't been there to save that girl.
Snipers are the worst scum! The bastard almost got me like he got that man!
That was too close. I could've ended up like that man.
That was too close... It could've been me lying there, bleeding, instead of that man.
What happened to that man proves that place's reputation. We should avoid it.
I didn't help that man... I was so scared.
We have to be careful, or we'll end up like that man.
I keep thinking about that man... It could've been one of us lying there, bleeding.
That poor man and his baby... Why didn't anyone help them?
Could I have helped that man? Or would he have bled to death anyway?
That man needed my help but I was scared, I didn't know what to do...
It's a shame ^CharacterName^ didn't help that man but {mr|he}{fr|she} could've got killed.
^CharacterName^ left that man to die. Was there anything {mr|he}{fr|she} could've done?
That poor man... Why didn't ^CharacterName^ help him?
Why did ^CharacterName^ ignore that man's call for help?
It's sad that ^CharacterName^ did not help that man. But I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} survived.
^CharacterName^ could've got killed by that sniper, if {mr|he}{fr|she} had tried to help that man.
Why do they hunt us like animals? What did we do to them?
What happened to that man could happen to any of us. We have to be careful.
One day we might all end up like that man, shot by a sniper. And no one will help us, either.
Will this killing never stop? How can those murderers shoot civilians like that? Poor man...
I was so worried about ^CharacterName^. I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} made it back alive.
^CharacterName^ could've got killed there. What would we do then?
^CharacterName^ told me about the sniper. I'm glad it wasn't me out there.
I can understand why ^CharacterName^ did not help that man. It was too dangerous.
I hope that sniper will burn in hell! How can he shoot civilians and stand to look at his own face in the mirror?
It was close, too close, but I made it, and that man was grateful.
It was worth helping that man, he was really grateful.
I helped that man but I'd rather not think about what would have happened if I'd got hit as well.
That man wouldn't have made it without my help, but I was lucky to survive too.
That man had no one else to help him. If it hadn't been for me, he'd be dead now.
I helped that man, but there's no telling if he survives another day.
I'm glad I could help that man. Every one of us could be in his position.
I helped that man, but how many more children will have lost their fathers before this war ends?
I'm so glad I could help that man and his child.
^CharacterName^ helped that man, but how many more children will be orphaned by this war?
What will come of that man's child? With this war around, can it have any hope for a happy childhood?
I'm so glad ^CharacterName^ helped that man and his child!
I feel much better knowing that man and his child are safe.
Fucking sniper finished the job and left the guy's corpse on the street. Do they think it will scare me off?
Another body at the Sniper Junction. I wonder if the shooter made a mark on his rifle.
I've seen what the sniper bullet did to that guy we'd met before. It might have been me.
That man's body reminded me how dangerous it is to search for supplies around the Sniper Junction.
The Sniper Junction is dangerous for scavengers, but that man was simply going back home...
It's not easy to cross the Sniper Junction, but it's possible. The man we'd met must've been too careless.
Another man killed by snipers. Maybe we should stay away from the Sniper Junction.
It's good that we didn't decide to hide in the vicinity of the Sniper Junction, it's even more dangerous than around here. Too bad the man we met didn't have such a choice.
I've seen too many people shot by snipers... And that man is not the first one to leave a child parentless.
If only I could have done something to help that man at the Sniper Junction... What will become of his family?
^CharacterName^ told us about the man killed by the sniper... I don't want to think about it.
I hope ^CharacterName^ doesn't blame {mr|himself}{fr|herself} for the death of that man at the Sniper Junction...
Could we have helped that man at the Sniper Junction...? I hope his son will be alright.
That man at the Sniper Junction had so much will to live on... Too bad it wasn't enough.
^CharacterName^ saw a man killed by the sniper. It would take just one sharpshooter set up near our place to kill us all.
How many lives has that sniper taken? The poor man joined the victim list.
^CharacterName^ said that the man from the Sniper Junction is dead. This is not the only place where you can get shot, we have to be extra careful.
^CharacterName^ should stay away from that damned place. There was nothing {mr|he}{fr|she} could do to help that man.
Our supplies are low, but sharing with the hospital can make a bigger impact.
I traded with the doctor at the hospital. It wasn't the best deal, but the hospital serves the whole community.
I donated some things to the hospital. Seemed to me they were in need.
When I saw the patients struggling at the hospital, I couldn't help myself but give the doctor some supplies. I hope this will help save more lives.
The things ^CharacterName^ donated to the hospital can save the patients' lives. I only hope we won't need those items in the future.
We can't really afford to give away our things, but it's good we've made an exception for the hospital.
We're in this together. It's our hospital and the patients' lives are our concern.
^CharacterName^ made the call and traded with the doctor. This time it was about something more than just our profit.
^CharacterName^ gave some things to the people at the hospital. We are yet to see if it can make any difference.
The patients now stand a better chance of survival. What about us, though? Will we live on...?
I admire ^CharacterName^ for helping those people at the hospital.
Helping others is our weapon against violence and insensitivity. ^CharacterName^ set a good example at the hospital.
I took some useful stuff from the hospital... Can they manage without it?
Those patients... I know it's not right to steal from hospitals but I gotta look after my group.
For some, it doesn't matter anymore if it's a hospital or a brothel. We've become animals, we only care about survival.
Those people are already sick... What will become of them, now that I've taken the hospital supplies?
It was wrong to steal from the hospital, but I was desperate. Our situation is really bad.
There's never enough bandages and medicine, but taking them from the hospital...?
^CharacterName^ must've been really desperate to rob the hospital.
It was ^CharacterName^ who robbed the hospital, but somehow I still feel responsible.
I know it's hard for us but... did it really have to be the hospital?
^CharacterName^ stole something from the hospital. Now we can live a little big longer at their expense.
There were times I would have condemned ^CharacterName^ for robbing the hospital...
The hospital still stands thanks to this famous doctor. He's a hero... While we're the opposite.
How could we rob a hospital? They're already having a hard time!
And, again, I risked my life for someone else...
This brothel is an evil place where women get hurt! I had to act, helping them was the right thing to do.
Clearly, some of the women in the brothel were mistreated by those gangsters. It was risky to help them but I hope it can inspire people to act.
Yeah, we saved someone in the brothel. But one spared life or two won't make any difference.
When ^CharacterName^ discovered that some women were working in the brothel against their will, {mr|he}{fr|she} decided to help them. I admire {mr|him}{fr|her} for that.
^CharacterName^ acted bravely in that brothel. What if someone we know ended up at the mercy of those thugs?
I don't really remember what happened in that hotel. Did I really save someone?
Those maniacs were doing horrible things to people. At least they won't hurt the one I met.
Our community doesn't need deranged criminals. I let them know we're vigilant.
I heard ^CharacterName^ saved a man held by some gang.
War brings out the worst in some, the best in others. I really hope we never become the former.
I'm sure ^CharacterName^ risked helping that hostage for a good reason.
I took two lives to save a few.
Killing those men was the only way to stop them. Dozens are now safer.
The snipers are this city's menace. Getting rid of those two wasn't easy, but it'll make the streets safer.
That rush of adrenaline... I'll gladly kill more of those bastards if I get the chance.
Snipers kill indiscriminately. It actually felt good to repay those bastards in kind!
They're killing us, we're killing them… One vicious circle.
Killing is wrong, but two armed soldiers in exchange for dozens of innocent civilians... I hope it justifies ^CharacterName^'s deed.
The people of the city should thank ^CharacterName^ for taking care of those snipers.
So hungry... I'd kill for a can of meat...
Has anyone got any food left? I have to eat something!
I'm really worried about our lack of food. I can hear my stomach rumbling.
We need to find more food, or we'll start starving.
I wish I could help ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} looks so hungry...
We need to make sure we have enough food for everybody!
Unless I eat something soon, I'm a goner...
How long has it been since I last ate? I'm starving...
I'm getting weaker each day... I'm starving...
My heart breaks when I look at ^CharacterName^... We must get {mr|him}{fr|her} some food.
Have we got any food left for ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} looks very hungry...
Look at ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} is so miserable... How long has it been since {mr|he}{fr|she} last ate?
We must get ^CharacterName^ some food, we can't let {mr|him}{fr|her} starve!
I'm so weak... If I don't get something to eat, I'm done for... I can't die here...
So hungry... Where the fuck is our food? I'm sure I saw a can somewhere! Who took it?
Please, get me some food... Anything will do, please... I'm dying here..
I guess this is it... with no food I'm as good as dead. I'd steal something if I could...
Food... I need to eat something... anything... please...
I'm starving... I guess there are worse ways to die...
I may die of hunger but at least others will live… maybe.
I won't forgive myself if ^CharacterName^ dies of hunger...
It's so painful to watch someone slowly starve to death...
With no food, ^CharacterName^'s as good as dead... Are we all destined to end up like that?
It pains me to watch ^CharacterName^ starve when the military have plenty of food. It's so unfair!
I'm afraid ^CharacterName^ will starve to death, soon. We are so miserable.
I guess this is it... If we can't get enough food, soon we'll start dying one by one...
We must find some food, or poor ^CharacterName^ is going to die.
We need to get some food and we need to act quickly! We can't let any of us die of hunger!
^CharacterName^ will probably die of those wounds. We should give {mr|him}{fr|her} a proper burial when {mr|he}{fr|she} does.
Is there anything we can do to save ^CharacterName^ from bleeding to death? I've lost all hope...
If we don't dress that wound properly, ^CharacterName^ will die. We must get the bandages at all cost!
We cannot let ^CharacterName^ die of these wounds! We have to do something!
^CharacterName^ won't make it through unless we dress that wound. We need bandages!
Unless we get some bandages, ^CharacterName^ will die! We can't let that happen, we need {mr|him}{fr|her}!
We need to get some bandages for ^CharacterName^ even if it means taking them from other people!
I'd rob a hospital if I knew this could save ^CharacterName^'s life.
^CharacterName^'s wounds are very serious... {mr|He}{fr|She} will probably die.
^CharacterName^ is dying... and without bandages there is nothing we can do about it.
^CharacterName^ is badly wounded and won't make it through without bandages...
^CharacterName^'s wound looks really bad, I hope it's not too late to get some bandages.
What the fuck happened to all our bandages?! I can't believe there are none left for me, I'm dying here!
I don't want to die... Please, anyone... tend to my wounds... please...
It hurts so much... Can't anyone share bandages with me?
Damn this wound... Please, help me... I'll die without bandages...
Help me, please! My wound hurts so much...
If my wounds aren't tended to, I'll die... I've gone this far... don't let me die now...
I need bandages... Please... Even if we have to take them from someone else...
This might be my end... Unless someone gets bandages, I'm not gonna make it... Please, help me...
I don't wanna die like this... not like this...
I'm badly wounded, I don't think I can make it through unless my friends get some bandages.
I gotta be strong, my friends have it rough as well. But it hurts so much...
^CharacterName^ committed murder. If this is what we have become, maybe we do deserve to die...
Have we started killing each other for scraps of food? How can we live like that?
^CharacterName^ murdered someone last night... I feel guilty, maybe I could have done something to prevent it...
Killing is not the way... How can we live with it when the war is over?
^CharacterName^ killed someone... What has it come to... Will we commit just about any crime to survive?
Is it really kill or be killed? I still hope it's not...
^CharacterName^ murdered someone in cold blood. I know {mr|he}{fr|she} did it for us. We're all guilty.
How many people do we have to kill to survive? Is it even worth it?
^CharacterName^ murdered someone last night... What have we become?
Are we gonna kill anyone who stands in our way? Are we willing to live with that?
I'm fed up with this war, but If someone stands in my way, I'll kill them without hesitation.
If ^CharacterName^ killed, there was probably no other way.
I'd rather ^CharacterName^ killed than if {mr|he}{fr|she} got killed. We need {mr|him}{fr|her}
I will not die here, I plan to survive this hell and I won't let anyone stand in my way.
It's the law of the jungle in war... You kill or you die, there's no other way... If I hadn't done that, someone else would have...
There was no other way. We need supplies to survive, how else are we supposed to get them?
This is war... we do everything to survive... I... I had no choice...
Death is the only way out of this hell... The dead have no more worries, they are the lucky ones.
I did not want to kill anyone... I'm not evil... I... I... had no choice...
I killed. It weighs heavily on my conscience, but that's the only way we can survive.
Some stranger died rather than me or any of my friends, and I prefer it that way. It's as simple as that.
I did what I did, for all of us. I know it's horrible and I'll have to live with it, but this is war.
^CharacterName^ took someone else's supplies. We might last a few more days if we're lucky.
We're like wretched rats, stealing from other poor souls to survive...
Is stealing really the only way to get what we need? What about those people we robbed, how are they to survive now?
How can we steal from others? They have a hard time trying to survive as well!
What matters is that we have supplies. How we got them is of less concern.
We can cry over stealing once we survive this hell.
^CharacterName^ did it for us. We should be thankful.
If we make it through, we will have ^CharacterName^ to thank.
Perhaps we shouldn't have stolen, but how else can we survive?
Supplies are so hard to come by. If ^CharacterName^ hadn't stolen goods, we'd be in an even worse situation now.
We really are wretched... fighting over bits and scraps, like rats.
Those poor people... I hope they will be ok... I feel terrible but we need supplies to survive...
Poor people... I know it was cruel to take their supplies but it's either them or us.
I had to steal. We need supplies and it's so hard to get them otherwise.
I'll steal if I fucking have to! I want to make it through, alive and kicking.
I don't plan to die here. If it means I sometimes have to steal, so be it.
Damn bandits! We should get some guns and kill the motherfuckers!
Damn bastards! I can't believe they dared come here! We should kill them all!
Damn thieves. As if we already didn't have it hard enough.
How am I to survive if thugs are trying to kill me and take my things?
Damn those looters! We need to protect our supplies.
Damn thugs! If they come again, they're dead!
We won't survive if we can't defend our shelter. We have to make sure we can.
Defending our shelter against looters is crucial. We need to make sure we have enough weapons and keep watch at night.
As if the war and shortage of supplies wasn't enough, someone came at night to rob us!
We need to make sure we can defend our shelter, otherwise we are done for.
^CharacterName^ didn't make it back last night. I'd cry, but I have no more tears left.
^CharacterName^ was killed. Which one of us will be next?
^CharacterName^ was killed last night while scavenging. If I had gone instead, maybe {mr|he}{fr|she} would still be with us.
I can't stop thinking about ^CharacterName^'s death. Could we have done anything to prevent it?
Bloody murderers! They killed ^CharacterName^!
^CharacterName^ is dead. I'd like to get my hands on {mr|his}{fr|her} killer!
^CharacterName^ was killed last night. I'm glad it wasn't me, I have to be careful.
I don't want to get killed like ^CharacterName^... Maybe I could stay in the shelter while someone else goes out to search for supplies.
Someone killed ^CharacterName^ last night! We should avenge {mr|him}{fr|her}!
I will never forgive ^CharacterName^'s killer! Never!
Another senseless death. No one cares if we live or die. The world has forsaken us.
If we can't protect our own, how are we to make it through this hell?
^CharacterName^ did not return from the scavenge last night. We will miss {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Oh, ^CharacterName^... We have to make sure this doesn't happen to anyone else!
We will have a much harder time without ^CharacterName^ to scavenge for us.
It's most unfortunate that ^CharacterName^ got {mr|himself}{fr|herself} killed.
^CharacterName^ didn't make it back alive. I will miss {mr|his}{fr|her} company.
It's really sad that ^CharacterName^ is no longer among us. We will relate {mr|his}{fr|her} story to {mr|his}{fr|her} close ones after the war.
We didn't even have enough supplies to save ^CharacterName^'s life. We are so wretched!
We lacked power to save ^CharacterName^'s life...
Sadly, ^CharacterName^ was beyond saving.
I wish we could've done something to save ^CharacterName^... If only we'd had more supplies...
Why did you have to die, ^CharacterName^? Was there really nothing we could do?
I'm afraid ^CharacterName^'s death is our fault. We could've been more tenacious in search for supplies.
^CharacterName^ died. I have to make sure we have enough food, bandages and meds in case I need them.
I don't want to end up like ^CharacterName^. There has to be a way to secure more supplies!
If someone had to die, better ^CharacterName^ than me.
We must get more supplies if we don't want to end up like ^CharacterName^.
We have to secure more food, meds and bandages, or we'll all die like ^CharacterName^.
^CharacterName^ could've been saved, but we are seriously undersupplied. We need to do something about it, no matter what.
Poor ^CharacterName^. If only we'd had enough supplies...
Couldn't we have done anything? Did ^CharacterName^ really have to die?
We must be more persistent in gathering supplies, so that none of us shares ^CharacterName^'s fate.
^CharacterName^'s death shows we are weak. We must make sure no one else dies.
We can't let any more of our friends die. Even if it means taking someone else's supplies.
^CharacterName^ died because we were not strong enough to secure the necessary supplies. We must be more tenacious.
We've lost ^CharacterName^. Without supplies, we're soon to follow.
Without the most vital supplies, we will all die like ^CharacterName^.
We didn't have enough supplies to save ^CharacterName^. If we don't find some, we're as good as dead, too.
^CharacterName^'s death could've been prevented, we just needed more supplies! Let's make sure this won't happen again.
I can't believe it. How could we let ^CharacterName^ die?
We've lost ^CharacterName^. We will not forget {mr|him}{fr|her}.
^CharacterName^ was killed last night by looters. War has turned people into beasts.
Shelling, snipers... And now this. People killing each other for scraps of food.
Bandits killed ^CharacterName^. We should've protected {mr|him}{fr|her} better...
^CharacterName^ was murdered in cold blood. I hope those criminals face trial when the war is over.
Fucking bandits! We will avenge ^CharacterName^ if they come back!
Bloody bastards! I hope you die and burn in hell for what you did to ^CharacterName^!
Looters killed ^CharacterName^. I was lucky it wasn't me.
That was close... It could've been me lying there dead instead of ^CharacterName^.
Too bad... but better ^CharacterName^ than me, I guess.
^CharacterName^ is dead. If the bandits come back, I might be next. We must get more guns!
With ^CharacterName^ killed by looters it will be much tougher to survive.
We have to defend ourselves! It's kill or be killed!
Bandits killed ^CharacterName^ last night! We must protect ourselves better!
If we don't find a way to keep bandits at bay, we will soon follow ^CharacterName^.
Bandits killed ^CharacterName^. If we can't defend ourselves, we won't survive.
We can't let them prey on us like that. We must avenge ^CharacterName^!
Bandits attacked us last night and killed ^CharacterName^. Next time it might be me, but I don't care anymore.
I don't care anymore. Let them kill us all, better to die quickly than suffer a long, slow death from hunger and disease.
Bandits attacked us last night and killed ^CharacterName^! We must keep watch and stick together!
If we can't protect each other from bandits, we're as good as dead. Let's be better prepared for the future.
They say freezing to death is like falling asleep. Maybe that's the best we can hope for.
^CharacterName^ froze to death... {mr|he}{fr|she} fell asleep and simply didn't wake up.
Poor ^CharacterName^ died of cold last night... If only we had gathered more firewood, {mr|he}{fr|she} would still be among us.
How could we let ^CharacterName^ freeze to death? We just needed more things to burn...
^CharacterName^ froze to death. If we don't find more firewood I could be next...
I don't want to die of hypothermia like ^CharacterName^, I must do something to prevent it.
The freezing cold took ^CharacterName^. We need to keep our shelter warmer.
That's it. We need more firewood, even if it means taking it from other people.
We must gather more firewood, otherwise we might all freeze like poor ^CharacterName^.
No amount of food and meds will save us if we can't keep our shelter warm.
We need to keep the shelter warm, otherwise we'll all die like ^CharacterName^.
We must gather something to burn in the heaters, even if it means taking it from someone else.
^CharacterName^ did not make it through the night. The winter cold will kill us where bullets and shells cannot.
Is that it, then? Are we all going to die of cold like ^CharacterName^?
How could we let ^CharacterName^ die of cold? We need to keep the fire up at all times if we want to survive.
If we want to make it, we must get something to burn in the heaters!
If I got my hands on whoever killed ^CharacterName^...
If I meet ^CharacterName^'s killers, they are dead.
I had a feeling it was a bad idea to go, but ^CharacterName^ wouldn't have listened anyway.
Leaving the shelter is so dangerous, we should avoid it unless absolutely necessary.
If I had gone instead of ^CharacterName^, it could be me lying dead somewhere.
We shouldn't be thinking about helping others when we've got so many problems on our heads. ^CharacterName^ didn't agree, and is now dead.
^CharacterName^ could not refuse to help our neighbor, and now {mr|he}{fr|she} is dead.
If ^CharacterName^ hadn't tried to help our neighbor, {ms|he}{fs|she}'d still be alive.
Perhaps ^CharacterName^ shouldn't have gone there, but now it's too late...
I'll miss ^CharacterName^. {mr|He}{fr|She} wasn't perfect, but none of us is.
^CharacterName^'s death goes only to show that we have to mind our own business.
If ^CharacterName^ had refused to go, {mr|he}{fr|she}'d still be with us. That was careless and unnecessary.
We've lost ^CharacterName^, and for what?
^CharacterName^ took an unnecessary risk, {mr|he}{fr|she} could still be with us.
One by one, they'll get us all...
We're like hunted animals. Poor ^CharacterName^ did not have to die like that...
Cold as it may sound, I think we should only care about our own, or we'll all end up like ^CharacterName^.
Losing ^CharacterName^ is a blow. {ms|He}{fs|She} shouldn't have gone to help people we barely know.
^CharacterName^ showed solidarity towards our neighbors and paid the highest price for it. I'll miss {mr|him}{fr|her}.
What ^CharacterName^ did was noble. We should help our neighbors whenever we can.
^CharacterName^ returned. What if {mr|he}{fr|she} doesn't come back one day?
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ returned to us safely.
I was worried about ^CharacterName^, I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} is back.
It's good to have ^CharacterName^ with us again.
The worst thing is waiting, when you don't know if your friend will be back or not.
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ is back, I need {mr|him}{fr|her}.
I knew ^CharacterName^ would make it back.
It's good that ^CharacterName^ returned. We need all hands on deck in order to survive.
I feel safer when we're all here together. I'm glad ^CharacterName^ is back.
Without meds I'm as good as dead. Has anyone got any left?
This sickness is killing me, maybe we could steal some meds?
I must get some meds. I don't care how. I don't want to die like this.
Unless I get some meds, I'll die. Surely, there is some way to get them? Someone must have them...
I can't die of sickness, I want to live! Do something!
Don't let me die, make sure I get some meds...
I'm very sick, but give the meds to the others first. I'll try to hold on a little longer.
This fever is terrible, but I wouldn't forgive myself if someone died because I took the meds that could have saved them.
I need meds, badly. Let's steal them if we have to.
Get me some meds, you need me!
If I don't get meds, I'm not going to pull through.
Don't let me die, please... please...
We're very sick, we desperately need meds.
This illness will kill us unless we get some meds.
My friends are sick... Is there any hope for them?
Disease is killing my friends, and I can't help them.
My friends are sick, I gotta help them get the meds!
Without my help my friends might die from disease, I must get them some medicine quickly.
We must get some meds somehow, anyhow!
Without meds, the disease will kill us all.
I must get meds for my friends. Whatever it takes.
Without meds my friends will die. I can't let that happen!
My friends are dying from disease and I am powerless to prevent it.
They're so sick... and I can't help them...
My friends are very sick, I have to do something!
I must do all I can to save my friends from the disease!
We are starving, maybe someone could share some food with us?
I'm so hungry, but we all need to share.
The situation is getting dire, we need food.
We can't just sit idly, we need to get food as soon as possible!
I have to eat something, I feel so weak...
Have we got any food left? I'm starving...
We won't survive if we can't get food.
We gotta get food somehow, we must think of something.
My friends are starving... I need to get food and share it with them.
It pains me to see my friends starve.
My friends are starving while I'm not. It's not right.
My friends need food. I should share with them.
This might be it... we're dying of hunger...
We're starving. Will anyone help? Maybe we could trade something for food...
Without food, is there still hope for us?
At least we will die together, my friends.
We failed to get enough food... this probably is the end.
Unless a miracle happens, we're as good as dead...
I don't care that others are hungry, too. I need food, or I'll die! And I don't intend to die here!
I'm starving! If I find out that someone ate my rations...
I need food or I'll die, can't you see?
You have to get me some food! You just have to!
They're dying of hunger...I should give them my share.
I should share the little I have with my friends. They're starving...
How can I eat when my friends are starving?
I shouldn't take another bite without sharing with my friends.
Are there any animals left in the city? I'm so hungry I'd even eat a rat, or a pigeon.
I must get some food at all cost. Gotta think of some way to do it.
Getting food is now a priority. We must persevere.
Without food we'll die, we must search harder for it.
I wish I could help my friends, they look so hungry...
My friends are very hungry, getting food for them should be my priority.
I'm fucking dying here, get me some bandages! Anyone!
Please, tend to my wounds... please...
Don't let me bleed to death. Dress my wounds, please.
Without bandages I'll die... help me...
I'm bleeding, you gotta get me some bandages.
Maybe someone could help us get the bandages we need...
We're wounded, we need help...
Is this it? After all I've been through, am I to die like this?
Just look at my wound... please, you have to do something about it...
We're wounded, we need bandages badly...
We need help, without bandages we'll bleed to death...
My friends are bleeding and I can't do anything about it...
I feel so helpless, my friends are wounded and I can't even ease their pain.
I'm worried about my friends... I have to get bandages for them!
It's so painful to watch my friends suffer from wounds.
I have to get my hands on some bandages! We won't survive without them.
Without bandages we're doomed. We need to get them!
That's it. My friends are getting bandages even if I have to steal them from someone!
I gotta get some bandages for my friends. We can trade something for them, can't we?
We haven't got enough bandages... I failed my friends...
It's hopeless... my friends are dying of wounds and I can't help them.
I gotta get some bandages for my friends!
I need to find some bandages tonight. I can't fail my friends!
What difference does it make if we hurt someone or not or if we're going to leave them with no supplies? They won't survive anyway.
I can't believe I hurt someone and took their things... Was that really necessary for our survival?
I know it was us or them, still I feel bad about it.
I did what was necessary. What matters is that I obtained some supplies.
I wouldn't have done it if our survival didn't depend on it.
So now we're hurting people and stealing from them...
It's one thing to steal and another to hurt someone while you're at it...
I still don't believe ^CharacterName^ hurt someone and stole their things.
Have we become brutal thugs?
If we have to use force to obtain supplies, so be it.
Reality is cruel. If we are to survive we have to be equally cruel.
I'd rather we didn't hurt anyone, but if our survival so requires...
Can't we manage without hurting others?
The strong always prey on the weak, we're no different.
Hurting others and robbing them... we've become bandits.
We're no better than the military, using force to get what they want.
I killed those people. They probably wouldn't have survived anyway. I just eased their pain.
They're dead. I'm alive. Better than the other way around.
That was risky, I'm glad I made it back alive.
I had to kill them, you must understand that I had no choice.
What I did was horrible but this is war. People kill each other all the time, don't they?
You mustn't tell anyone I did it. Don't even think about it.
Think about your families and loved ones. We have to survive for them, no matter the cost.
I did what was necessary to ensure our survival. You would've done the same.
If we have to kill to survive, so be it.
Maybe those people deserved to die? Maybe they committed some horrible crime?
In the animal world it's kill or be killed. War turns us into animals.
I regret what I did, but you must understand me, everyone wants to survive.
I'll never manage to wash their blood off my hands... this'll haunt me forever.
I didn't want to kill anyone, I didn't want it to happen, but it did! Leave me alone! I can't live like this... I...
I really don't want to talk about what happened there, please don't ask...
I still can't believe those people are dead. And that it was I who did it...
I don't know how I should go on, knowing that I killed those people. Maybe it would have been better if I had died there instead.
Poor people... I really didn't want it to end like that...
I didn't intend to kill anyone. It's this ugly war. It turned brothers against brothers.
I'm not proud of what I did. If only there had been any other way,...
Sooner or later, everyone in this damned city will be dead. It's just a matter of time.
Those people stood in the way of our survival. I had no choice, did I?
I did what was necessary. Don't ask me about it ever again.
Don't presume to judge me. You weren't there.
I did not want to kill anyone, you have to believe me. You have to.
I did it for all of us. I'll do whatever is necessary to get us through this hell.
If only those deaths could've been avoided...
War turns decent people into murderers... maybe we'd be better off if we had died in the first days of this conflict.
We all have to live now with the thought that ^CharacterName^ killed those people for us...
What will happen to ^CharacterName^ when the war is over? Will {mr|he}{fr|she} go to prison?
^CharacterName^ must now be going through hell after all the things {mr|he}{fr|she} did.
I still can't believe ^CharacterName^ killed those people. How could {mr|he}{fr|she}?
To be forced to take other people's lives... That must've been horribly painful for ^CharacterName^.
What ^CharacterName^ did was terrible, but who are we to judge {mr|him}{fr|her}? We weren't there.
If my life was at stake, I'd defend myself. ^CharacterName^ did just that. Let's not talk about it anymore.
Those deaths will weigh heavily on ^CharacterName^'s conscience, but thanks to {mr|him}{fr|her} we will survive.
Now we all have to live with the thought that ^CharacterName^ killed those people for us...
We're no better than criminals. Maybe we don't deserve to survive this war.
If anyone saw ^CharacterName^ kill those people, after the war {mr|he}{fr|she} will get a life sentence.
^CharacterName^ must have had no choice. Otherwise {mr|he}{fr|she} wouldn't have killed those people.
^CharacterName^ did what {mr|he}{fr|she} thought was necessary to secure our survival, no matter how horrible it was.
I hope we won't have to kill anyone anymore...
Blood... So much blood...
I killed many people, they're all dead now...
I... I... Don't know how it happened... Don't ask me about it...
It didn't happen, it was just a nightmare, I'll wake up and everything will be alright...
Those fuckers deserved to die! I killed them and I'll kill again if I have to!
What are those deaths in comparison with all other casualties of this war? Just a drop in the ocean.
Killing will never stop. We might as well get used to it.
I'm not proud of what I've done, but I really had no choice.
I'd rather kill than get killed.
We're back to the stone age. Fighting other tribes for survival. Can anyone blame us?
For now, only survival matters. There will be time for regrets when the war is over.
I'd never kill anyone unless I had no choice, you must believe me.
Those people are dead now, but there was no other way.
Are we a menace to society?
I've got so much blood on my hands, I'm a war criminal.
I killed many people so that we can live. Can you forgive me?
My only concern is that we make it through this war alive. The end justifies the means.
I didn't want to kill anyone. But those people were a threat to us.
Trust me, it wasn't easy for me to kill all those people. I wouldn't have done it if it weren't necessary.
^CharacterName^ massacred those poor people...
All those people, murdered by ^CharacterName^, and for what?
I can't believe ^CharacterName^ has become a mass murderer...
How could ^CharacterName^ kill all those people? How?
I don't give a fuck if ^CharacterName^ killed someone or not as long as we're alive!
Come on, we have bigger problems than worrying about some people ^CharacterName^ killed.
Whining is useless. Those people are dead and nothing can change that now.
I don't care what any of you do as long as you bring back food and other supplies.
What you do out in the city is none of my business as long as you bring back some supplies.
I don't want to know what happened while you were scavenging. That's none of my business.
Maybe those people ^CharacterName^ killed deserved their fate. Maybe {mr|he}{fr|she} did the city a favor?
I just want us to survive, I won't ask what ^CharacterName^ had to do to ensure it.
Killing is horrible, but what choice did ^CharacterName^ have?
Everyone wants to survive no matter what. Anything can happen if you let your instincts take over.
It's either us or the other groups. I don't blame ^CharacterName^ for what {mr|he}{fr|she} did.
^CharacterName^ made a tough decision and has to bear the consequences. But we're not the ones to judge {mr|him}{fr|her}.
If this siege lasts any longer, we'll all kill each other without the help of the government military.
Pogoren will soon become a ghost city. We'll all end up in a mass grave.
Poor ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} must feel horrible now...
We should show our support to ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} killed those people for us.
^CharacterName^ is surely going through a hard time now, let's show {mr|him}{fr|her} our support.
I'd love a cup of coffee...
Another day without coffee.
A cup of coffee would be lovely. Have we got any left?
I really miss coffee, how can we work without it?
I need coffee! I haven't had anything with caffeine for a few days now.
I need a smoke to calm my nerves.
Are there any cigarettes left?
I really need a cigarette.
I need to smoke. I haven't smoked anything for a few days now.
I have to get some cigarettes.
I wonder if that girl, Anna, is alright. I hope she is.
I hope that boy finds his Anna. If she comes here, we'll tell her he was looking for her.
There's never enough meds. We can use these. That girl probably won't come.
Meds are invaluable. We can use them or trade them for something. That girl is most likely dead anyway.
Maybe we should keep these meds for ourselves? What are the odds that the girl is even alive?
That girl probably won't come, maybe we could put these meds to good use.
Naive boy. His Anna is probably dead. He should've kept the meds for himself.
Even if that girl comes, we don't have to tell her the boy left her some meds. How would she find out the truth?
That boy cares about this Anna so much that he trusted us. Will she really come here? I wonder.
That Anna is one lucky girl to have such a friend. Most people would just keep the meds for themselves.
Maybe we should've taken those meds for keeping? This Anna girl might really need them.
Perhaps we should've taken those meds for Anna. What if she comes here?
We should've taken those meds, we could really use them.
It would be nice to have some extra meds at hand. We should've taken them.
It was kind of that boy to try and help his girlfriend. Maybe he can still find her.
Poor boy, he still has hope but his girlfriend is probably dead by now. We could've taken the meds, though.
I'm really glad we decided to help that wounded man!
We did the right thing, that wounded man needed our help!
When life gets tough, people should stick together. I'm glad we could help our wounded neighbor.
Helping our neighbor was the right thing to do. I'm glad we did it.
I'm glad we helped our wounded neighbor. If we hadn't, he'd be dead by now.
We helped that wounded man. So if we're in trouble one day, maybe someone will help us as well.
Why didn't we help our wounded neighbor? Why?
I can't believe we didn't help our neighbor in need. What has become of us?
Our wounded neighbor had only us to count on and we failed him.
We should've helped our wounded neighbor. Why didn't we?
We left our neighbor to die in the street. Was it really too dangerous to help him?
It was wrong not to help our wounded neighbor. Just wrong.
If only I had someone to guard the shelter I could have helped my neighbor's wounded brother.
We should help each other, especially in times like these. I'm really glad we decided to help our neighbors.
Our neighbors were kind to us, I'm very glad we decided to help them.
They could've reinforced their shelter without our help. It isn't really our problem.
Helping those people is an unnecessary risk. We need every pair of hands.
I'm glad we could repay our neighbors for their kindness.
Thank to us, our neighbors will be safer. I'm glad we decided to help them.
It was very ungrateful of us not to repay our neighbors for their kindness.
We should've helped our neighbors. They were kind to us.
Our neighbors' shelter is their problem. We've got plenty of our own problems.
Sure, they were nice to us, but maybe because they had been planning to use our help all along?
We could've helped our neighbors in need, but we did not, even though they had been nice to us.
We're not very good neighbors are we? We should've helped them reinforce their shelter.
I couldn't help my neighbors reinforce their cellar, I had no one to guard my own shelter.
We knew how dangerous it was to go to that funeral, we shouldn't have taken that risk.
Going to a funeral under sniper fire? How can anyone be so careless?
It is dangerous, but we just have to help that poor girl bury her husband.
Her husband deserves a decent funeral. We will help her bury him despite the risk.
She must've loved him very much, she risked her life trying to give him a proper funeral. We should've helped her.
It pains me to see that kind girl suffer so much. I don't want to think how many more families are torn apart by war like that.
It would be ironic and kind of romantic if she got shot while trying to bury her husband.
I wish someone would love me so much as to risk their life to give me a proper funeral.
Helping that girl bury her husband wouldn't change anything. He's dead either way and she has to live with it.
Risk our lives to bury a dead person? That would be just plain stupid.
Should we have risked our lives to help bury that girl's husband under sniper fire?
Whoever said that love conquers all was wrong. He's dead. She lives. She's young, she'll carry on, forget about him and marry again.
I was really sorry, but I couldn't help my neighbor bury her husband. I had to stay in the shelter.
I'm happy we could help those children. I really hope their mother will recover.
Poor kids, I'd rather not think what would happen if we hadn't given them those meds.
We just couldn't leave those poor kids without help. That would be callous.
Those kids are very brave. They risk their lives walking around the neighborhood to save their mother.
Meds are hard to come by, but we did the right thing.
Poor children, I hope our meds are enough to help their mother.
How could we be so callous and not help those poor kids?
Did we really leave those kids without any help?
We should've helped those kids, they're our neighbors. If we don't help them, who will?
Let's hope some other neighbor helps those kids get meds for their mother.
I wish we had enough meds to share them with anyone in need. We just have to grit our teeth and wait for a ceasefire.
There's no telling if these kids were telling the truth. Maybe they'd just sell our meds to someone?
Those children asking for meds were out of luck. Our cabinet was empty.
We'd have given those children meds if we'd only had any left.
Unfortunately we had no meds to give to those poor children.
We haven't got much to share, but a smile on a child's face is priceless.
We must help one another despite the hardships. I'm glad we shared food with those kids.
We gave those children some food, but I don't think they'll make it through anyway.
I'm afraid that despite our help these kids might not make it through.
I'm glad we helped those kids and their mother. I hope they'll make it through.
We haven't got much in terms of supplies, but we did the right thing.
When this war is over we'll throw a barbecue party, invite all our neighbors, and eat until we're stuffed.
Kids are our future, we have to do everything to save them and show them that despite the war there are good people among us, too.
A hungry child is a heartbreaking sight. I'm glad we gave them some food.
No child should ever be hungry. We just had to share food with them.
It's a shame we didn't share food with those hungry children.
The sight of hungry children is heartbreaking.
Someone will surely help those kids, we haven't got enough food to share.
What if these kids were lying? We gave them meds, maybe they thought us naive enough to give them anything they asked for?
Poor kids, It's sad we didn't give them any food, but we need it just as badly as they do.
How do we know these kids were telling the truth? Maybe someone sent them to take advantage of our compassion?
We should've given those children some food. Their eyes were so sad...
Let's hope some other neighbor shares food with those kids.
I wish we had enough food to share them with anyone in need. We just have to grit our teeth and wait for a ceasefire.
There's no telling if these kids were telling the truth. Maybe they'd just sell our food to someone?
We'd share some food with those hungry children, if only we had any left.
It was sad that we couldn't help those hungry children.
I wish we could have helped those children.
That woman might die of illness. Even if we haven't done more for her, at least we can help take her to hospital.
I'm relieved that we decided to take that woman to hospital, but it could've been avoided if we had given her the meds she needed.
We won't let those children become orphaned, we will save their mother. I just wish we could do more for them.
Maybe if we had given those children the meds they'd asked for, there would be no need to take their mother to hospital.
We're saving those children's mother. She should be grateful.
I feel good about helping those children's mother. I hope it's in her nature to give back.
Those children were wise to come to us for help. They nearly lost their mother.
We just couldn't refuse to help those children's mother. I hope someone would do the same for us.
Did we really ignore those children's pleas? I'm at a loss for words.
I can't believe we didn't take those children's mother to hospital.
We should've at least tried to save those children's mother.
Even if going out in broad daylight is risky, we should not have left those children without help.
The military are responsible for shortages in supplies. Those children's mother would be alright if not for them!
Were we to risk coming under sniper fire in broad daylight trying to help some stranger? I'm not convinced.
Would sending someone to try to get that woman to hospital be worth it? It would probably have resulted in both of them getting shot.
We didn't risk helping those children's mother. We could have been shot by a sniper, but it still makes me sad.
Maybe we could've done something to help those children's mother, but can anyone blame us for not risking our lives for a stranger?
I couldn't help those children take their mother to hospital. My shelter could've got ransacked in my absence.
I'm glad we decided to help our neighbors. We should save as many lives as possible.
Those people buried under falling debris needed our help, and we didn't fail them.
If a shell hit our shelter, we could be in a similar situation to those people. They could count on us, I hope we can count on them.
We just had to go help our neighbors. They would probably do the same for us.
I'm glad we helped the people from that collapsed house. It was the right thing to do.
The people from that collapsed house have good neighbors who didn't leave them to their fate. Many others are less fortunate.
Those poor people... Buried alive or crushed under tons of rubble. Horrible.
How can the military fire artillery shells at civilians? How can they sleep at night after doing such things?
We should've helped our neighbors from that collapsed building.
We should support each other. We all live in the same street, and yet we left those people to their fate.
Poor people. If I were to choose, I think I'd rather be crushed immediately than suffocate slowly under tonnes of debris.
I don't want to imagine what I'd do if I were buried under tons of rubble from a collapsed building.
I couldn't leave the shelter unguarded, even though those people really needed my help.
I'm glad that girl's father is alright. She shouldn't have brought us some gift, though.
I'm sure those earrings were dear to her, but it would have been rude to refuse her gift. What matters is that her father is alright.
It's good to know some people remember what gratitude is. We can trade those earrings for something we need.
It was nice of that girl to thank us. Her gift will come in handy when we need to barter for something.
Those earrings will go for a good price. I'm glad we didn't refuse to take them.
It would be stupid to refuse such a nice gift. We can trade those earrings for something we need, such as food.
It was nice of that girl to come and thank us like that.
I'm glad we could help. I'd be grateful too if someone saved my loved one.
I'm glad we helped that girl's father and that we refused to take those earrings. They were precious to her.
Relief in that girl's eyes was reward enough. It was a good decision to refuse a gift of her mother's earrings.
Those earrings were worth a lot, we could have traded them for something we need!
Why didn't we take those earrings? Have we got too much stuff to trade?
Maybe we should've accepted that girl's earrings. We could trade them for something useful later.
That girl wanted to express her gratitude, we shouldn't have refused to take those earrings.
Her gratitude was fine and all, but I sure could use that girl's earrings. They'd buy me a can of meat, or even two.
It was stupid to refuse such a generous gift! Those earrings would have fetched a good price.
I think it wasn't a good decision to refuse that girl's gift.
She wanted us to have those earrings, we should've taken them.
It was nice of that girl to offer us her mother's earrings, but we didn't help her father just to get a reward.
It was nice of her to come over to thank us, but she didn't have to bring a gift for us.
I know we need supplies, but I feel bad about helping our neighbor rob that family.
Regardless of our motivations, helping our neighbor rob that family is wrong.
We need supplies, and that family has them. I know it's wrong to steal, but we need to survive somehow.
No one would think of robbing that family if they had shared their stashed supplies. They're just asking for it.
I feel kinda bad. We're helping our neighbor, but it means robbing some other people.
Stealing from those folks is a way to help our neighbor and ourselves, even if it is morally wrong.
I'm glad we decided to help rob that family. They deserve it, sitting on all those supplies and not sharing with anyone!
If we could survive without stealing, we wouldn't steal, would we?
I guess this goes to show that you've got to be able to defend yourself if you're sitting on stashed supplies.
I'm glad we refused to rob that family. That would be wrong.
Even if that family really is sitting on supplies, I don't think stealing is the way to go.
I think we could've taken a few things from that family. Not much, just enough to help us survive.
Maybe we should've helped our neighbor take supplies from that selfish family?
That selfish family our neighbor told us about was asking for it. Maybe we should've gone with him.
If we had taken some supplies from that family our neighbor was talking about, we would be much better off now.
I still think our neighbor was right. We should've taken some supplies from those selfish bastards!
Even though we're pressed for supplies, I think we did the right thing refusing to help rob that family.
That family is selfish and they are ignoring the tragic situation of their neighbors, but stealing from them would not be the way to go.
I feel really bad about deciding to steal from the hospital warehouse. Other people might need meds and bandages as much as we do.
Stealing from that hospital warehouse is wrong. We shouldn't have even considered it.
What matters is that we will have some medical supplies. Does it really make any difference how we get them as long as we can survive?
We wouldn't have decided to steal those meds and bandages if we weren't so hard pressed for them. It's not our fault there are shortages.
Did we have a choice? Acquiring medical supplies is becoming increasingly difficult.
We really need those medical supplies. What were we supposed to do?
I know I should feel bad about stealing those medical supplies, but I don't. We really need them.
A bandage or two doesn't make a world of difference to the hospital, and they're a lifesaver for us.
There's no doubt we need medical supplies, but this doesn't make me feel any less guilty about stealing them.
Desperate times require desperate measures. These medical supplies might mean the difference between life and death for us.
I can't believe we reported on our neighbor to those rebel soldiers. How could we?
How could we snitch to those soldiers about our neighbor? That was really shameful.
Maybe reporting on our neighbor wasn't the right thing to do, but neither was stealing from that humanitarian aid container.
So what if we acted like snitches. That man knew the risk.
We acted like a bunch of snitches. Disgraceful.
Our neighbor put his trust in us, and we snitched to those rebel soldiers. We should be ashamed of ourselves.
I hate those rebels as much as I hate the military! We shouldn't have cooperated with them.
By reporting our neighbor to those soldiers we at least saved our own skins and even got something out of it.
That neighbor knew the risk. Telling on him to those rebel soldiers was necessary to divert their attention from us.
I feel dirty. We shouldn't have confirmed those soldiers' suspicions.
We betrayed our neighbor. Plain and simple.
I think we did the right thing by not reporting on our neighbor to those rebel soldiers, I just hope we don't get into trouble because of that.
We sure could use whatever reward they were going to give us, but we aren't snitches, are we.
There's no way we were going to snitch to those soldiers! Solidarity between neighbors is important!
We'd never betray our neighbor's trust. We're in this hell together, we have to help each other.
I'm glad we denied those rebel soldiers' suspicions regarding our neighbour. They can go to hell!
If we had confirmed those soldiers' suspicions, we could have profited. They said there was a reward.
I hope covering our neighbor's ass doesn't get us into trouble.
Our neighbor trusted us and we did not fail him. He would surely do the same for us, wouldn't he?
Between the rebels and the military, we have to stick together to survive. I'm glad we did not confirm those soldiers' suspicions regarding our neighbor.
Our neighbor was right to ask for our help. We will help make her house more secure.
I'm glad we decided to help our neighbor in need. Supporting each other is important.
Securing our neighbor's house is not our problem, ^CharacterName^ shouldn't have gone there.
I'm not happy ^CharacterName^ went to spend the night at our neighbor's house, we need everyone to guard the shelter and scavenge.
Our neighbor looked really worried about her own and her daughter's safety. I'm glad we decided to help them.
We couldn't leave our neighbor without help. She was really scared.
How could we refuse to help our neighbor secure her house? She was so worried.
Without our help, our neighbor's house is much more vulnerable.
Securing our neighbor's house was not our problem. We needed every pair of hands here.
I wouldn't be happy if someone had gone to our neighbor's house. We have our own problems here.
Our neighbor was worried about her own and her daughter's safety. I'm sorry we didn't help them.
How could we leave our neighbor without help? She was really scared.
Unfortunately, those women had to seek help elsewhere.
We couldn't help those women board up their windows.
We would've helped those women if we could.
I'm so relieved we agreed to help our neighbor in distress.
I feared we might not agree to help our neighbor in need. I'm glad we did.
Those bandits need to be taught a lesson!
If you ask me, we should care more about our own and less about other people.
Was helping our neighbor necessary? I don't think so.
I'm not sure helping our neighbor is worth the risk.
Was helping our neighbor necessary? I'm not sure.
I'm glad we decided to help protect our neighbor and her daughter against bandits.
We just couldn't leave our neighbor in need. She was terrified.
I hope nothing bad happened to our neighbour. Someone should've gone with her.
I'm really worried about our neighbor. We should have sent someone with her.
Why didn't we help our neighbor in distress? Was it indifference or cowardice?
Our neighbor needed our help and we failed her. I hope she and her daughter are okay.
We didn't help our neighbor, so what? We've got our own problems.
Our neighbor needed help, but so do we. Is there anyone here to help us?
I'm disappointed we didn't help protect our neighbor and her daughter against bandits.
How could we leave our neighbor in need? She was terrified.
I couldn't leave the shelter to help protect my neighbors. Someone could've broken into my shelter and robbed me.
War drove ^CharacterName^ to take {mr|his}{fr|her} own life. Are we next?
This is horrible! ^CharacterName^ committed suicide, {mr|he}{fr|she} couldn't take it anymore. I wish we could've done something.
^CharacterName^ took {mr|his}{fr|her} own life. Maybe it's better this way. {mr|He}{fr|She} no longer has to suffer.
Regretfully, ^CharacterName^ committed suicide. Will we all be driven to that as well?
^CharacterName^ killed {mr|himself}{fr|herself}. Maybe we should all do the same, that would be easier than having to endure this hell.
^CharacterName^ committed suicide, leaving us on our own. It was a very tragic, yet very selfish act.
That's a pity... ^CharacterName^ was one of us. It's our fault that {mr|he}{fr|she} couldn't take it anymore.
Fuck! How could ^CharacterName^ leave us like that! We need every pair of hands!
^CharacterName^ took the coward's way out. At least now we don't need to look after {mr|him}{fr|her}.
^CharacterName^ committed suicide. I don't want to end up like that. I must get a grip.
^CharacterName^ left us... {mr|He}{fr|She} won't survive alone, I'm afraid.
^CharacterName^ left us last night... Even though {mr|he}{fr|she} took our things, I hope {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll be alright.
^CharacterName^ acted selfishly, but I still hope {mr|he}{fr|she} will make it out of Pogoren safely.
Damn it! ^CharacterName^ ran away with our supplies, it will be difficult to survive now.
Without the supplies ^CharacterName^ took, we might not make it through.
Where's ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} left us, leaving us almost nothing. Some friend!
How could ^CharacterName^ be so false?! We trusted {mr|him}{fr|her}!
^CharacterName^ fled with our supplies! How stupid! Only as a group do we stand any chances!
How could ^CharacterName^ betray us like that?!
Fuck! ^CharacterName^ stole our supplies and ran away! I'll kill {mr|him}{fr|her} if I get the chance!
^CharacterName^ stole our things and ran away! I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} dies!
^CharacterName^ disappeared with our supplies! Could it get any worse?
It was hard even when ^CharacterName^ was with us. And now {mr|he}{fr|she}'s gone, along with our supplies!
We're better off without ^CharacterName^ anyway.
^CharacterName^ left us... I'm sure we had better chances together.
If ^CharacterName^ prefers to be alone rather than with us, so be it.
^CharacterName^ left us? {mr|He}{fr|She}'d better not get us into trouble!
We don't really need ^CharacterName^. We can make it through without {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Now that ^CharacterName^ is gone, we can split {mr|his}{fr|her} share of supplies among us.
Did ^CharacterName^ leave because we mistreated {mr|him}{fr|her}?
It's so sad when you realize that ^CharacterName^ is somewhere out there, all alone.
I wish ^CharacterName^ good luck, but I'm afraid {mr|he}{fr|she} might not make it on {mr|his}{fr|her} own.
I doubt ^CharacterName^ can make it on {mr|his}{fr|her} own.
Small wonder ^CharacterName^ left us. We didn't treat {mr|him}{fr|her} well.
If I were ^CharacterName^, I'd leave too.
I feel like scum. We should've treated ^CharacterName^ better.
We were unfair toward ^CharacterName^, and that's why {mr|he}{fr|she} left us.
^CharacterName^ ran away. Good riddance. Fewer mouths to feed.
I don't think ^CharacterName^ will survive without us.
We didn't do enough for ^CharacterName^, yet I don't think leaving us was a good decision.
^CharacterName^ left us? Fuck it, we don't need {mr|him}{fr|her}!
^CharacterName^ left. We'll get used to {mr|his}{fr|her} absence.
^CharacterName^ was useful to us, too bad {mr|he}{fr|she}'s gone.
^CharacterName^ will come back, just wait and see.
We failed ^CharacterName^, that's why {mr|he}{fr|she} left.
^CharacterName^ wasn't good enough to be one of us.
We should've treated ^CharacterName^ better. {mr|He}{fr|She} was one of us.
It's our fault ^CharacterName^ left us.
We shouldn't mistreat ^CharacterName^ like that...
I think we should be more fair toward ^CharacterName^.
^CharacterName^ is one of us, we should treat {mr|him}{fr|her} better.
We shouldn't mistreat ^CharacterName^ like that, we're all in this together.
Treat me fairly or I'm gonna beat you bloody!
If I'm not treated fairly, I'll get really angry!
They don't know what I'm capable of. If they keep mistreating me, they'll see.
Nobody cares about me, maybe I should just go outside and take a sniper's bullet.
I'd like to know why I am mistreated. Did I do something wrong?
I don't understand... Why am I treated like someone worse?
Why, when there aren't enough supplies for all of us, I am always the one left empty handed?
If I'm not treated fairly, I'm gonna look for support elsewhere.
I thought we were a group, why am I being mistreated?
We should share everything and stick together. Why am I being treated unfairly?
Armed thugs have everything while decent people are left to scavenge and steal. That's so unfair.
It was dangerous to steal from those thugs, but I made it.
It was a risky way of getting supplies. I hope it was worth it.
By stealing from those thugs, we did the city a favor.
I was worried about ^CharacterName^. Stealing from armed thugs is like playing dice with death.
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ stole from those bandits. We'll make better use of their supplies than they would.
If we need to steal to survive, I'd rather we would steal from thugs than innocent people. My only concern is that it's dangerous.
They had been robbing helpless civilians. ^CharacterName^ managed to return the favor.
Damn it, the military have food, meds, everything. And what do we have?
They have everything while we have nothing. That's so unfair.
I'm glad I made it back alive, it was very risky to steal from soldiers.
It's sad to see that soldiers who are trying to kill us are so well supplied.
The army is well supplied while people in the city starve and die of diseases.
Stealing from soldiers was dangerous, but I feel satisfied. They shoot at us and our neighbors.
It's a huge risk to steal from soldiers, but it might pay off.
^CharacterName^ was lucky not to get killed by those soldiers.
I was worried about ^CharacterName^. The military are not to be trifled with.
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ is back. It's a huge risk to steal from the army men.
Those soldiers won't even miss what ^CharacterName^ took, they have supply lines. We don't.
I can't believe I managed to kill a soldier...
I wonder if that soldier I killed has a family that will miss him...
I'm not proud of killing that soldier, yet my deed may have saved someone else. Maybe even our neighbors.
I somehow managed to survive... but I'd rather not think how dangerous that was.
^CharacterName^ killed a soldier? Good.
I wish ^CharacterName^ hadn't killed that soldier. Maybe he was drafted against his will?
It would have been better if ^CharacterName^ hadn't killed anyone, but maybe that soldier was one of those trying to kill us.
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ made it back. Confronting a soldier was very risky.
I got one of those scumbags, but I can still hear my heart pounding.
I only hope that the thug's death saves other people's lives.
That guy was a threat to us and our neighbors, I had to get rid of him.
I managed to kill a bandit and come back alive, but it was very dangerous.
^CharacterName^ killed a bandit? Good riddance. One scum less to take advantage of helpless people.
I'm not sure what to think about ^CharacterName^'s deed. That guy was a bandit, but was killing him necessary?
^CharacterName^ killed a bandit. We should show {mr|him}{fr|her} our support.
^CharacterName^ could've got killed by that thug. I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} managed to come back.
One or more soldiers dead, what's the difference? They don't care how many of us they kill, either.
I couldn't avoid killing those soldiers. I'll have to live with that somehow.
Those soldiers were a threat to us all, something had to be done.
Killing soldiers is like playing with fire. If they find us, we're dead.
How did ^CharacterName^ manage to kill those soldiers? I didn't know {mr|he}{fr||she} had it in {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Yes, they were soldiers, yes, they were trying to kill us... But they probably had families, just like us...
Those soldiers were people like us, but they would've killed ^CharacterName^ all the same, had {mr|he}{fr|she} failed to kill them.
Let's not think about the lives ^CharacterName^ took, let's think about lives {mr|he}{fr|she} saved.
I'm still trembling, I'm lucky to have made it back alive.
At least those thugs won't bother anyone anymore. If only killing them had not been necessary.
Criminals thrive during wartime. At least those individuals are no longer a threat to anyone.
Encountering those bandits was fucking insane, but I somehow made it back alive.
The way {mr|he}{fr|she} handled those thugs... ^CharacterName^ is one tough cookie.
Meeting those thugs must've been a horrible experience for ^CharacterName^.
I'm glad we didn't lose ^CharacterName^. {mr|He}{fr|She} took a huge risk out there.
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ survived {mr|his}{fr|her} encounter with those bandits.

The city is cut off, but the situation could be worse. The shortages of supplies are a problem, but not a drastic one yet. Crime is not rampant yet, as people still prefer to scavenge for supplies rather than rob others. People are hopeful, and neighbours often stick together and try to help one another.
The situation in the city is severe. There are shortages of everything, and black market prices fluctuate. Bands of looters attack homes at night, as desperate people turn to crime to survive. People have some hope, but neighbours aren’t quick to help one another.
The ongoing siege means the situation in the city is dire. Even the most basic supplies are difficult to get. Black market prices skyrocket. Desperate people scour the streets and ruins clean of everything of any use. Bandits roam the city and nobody is safe in their home. People have little hope, and are unwilling to help one another.

MY STORY
Abandoned Cottage
A family barricaded themselves in this house, but despite their efforts looters got inside. It's been abandoned ever since. Still, we might find some useful things that the looters overlooked or left behind.
The looters must've been in a hurry, there's still a lot of stuff left.
A family photo of parents and two daughters. Good thing the girls don't resemble their father. He looks like a bear.
A note that says: </n></n>"On the first day they robbed us. Two days later they murdered our girls. I shot every one of them. But I don't want to use the gun anymore, it's broken and buried in the backyard."</n></n>The next part looks shaky: </n></n>"If you're reading this - don't look for me."
Shelled Cottage
This neighborhood recently got shelled and many houses are still burning. People were fleeing for their lives in a hurry, so we may find some useful stuff there without meeting anyone.
The house is still burning, is it safe to go inside?
One of the flyers dropped on the city. It reads: </n></n>"This is a zone of anti-terrorist operation. Persons remaining in the city will be treated as terrorist supporters. FOR YOUR OWN AND YOUR FAMILY'S SAFETY, LEAVE POGOREN IMMEDIATELY! The army guarantees you a safe passage."</n></n>Not many believed them after the atrocities they had committed.
Ruined Block of Flats
This block of flats has seen some heavy fighting. Most people had fled the area before the Vyseni rebels clashed there with the military. The battle is over now, and there should be many things left to scavenge, because people were leaving in a rush.
It's so empty and quiet here, it gives me the creeps.
The baby carriage isn't empty. A few objects lie scattered inside - a rattle, a smiling red crab, well worn by baby teeth, a feeding bottle half-full of congealed mass that was probably a baby formula. Someone must have left in a terrible rush... or maybe didn't need them anymore.
Before the war, you could have your car repaired there. It was a decent family business, run by an impulsive son and his elderly father. If they still live there, they might be willing to trade with us. Alternatively, we might find lots of useful parts there and maybe even some food.
Garage
I wonder if the owners are still around.
Someone scrawled on the wall: </n></n>"NO MORE HIDING </n>WE MEET IN HEAVEN"
Small Apartment Building
This old apartment building is owned by an elderly couple and their son. They are still around, somehow managing to fend off looters. They probably have supplies like food and meds but won't be willing to share them with us. We can try to steal or take them by force. Lock picks might come in handy.
This old apartment building used to be owned by an elderly couple and their son, but they fled before the siege. There are rumors of some shady-looking, well armed individuals taking refuge there. We had better be careful if we decide to go there.
It's the back of the building, I should be able to sneak in.
I should be careful, the rumors about bandits might be true.
I found a 'to do' list. It must be a group with some crude regime. This point is interesting: </n></n>"Who's leaving booze behind the shitter?! Clean up the mess!"
They've taken down all the pictures, but left this one - with little girls on a beach. I don't wanna know the reasons.
Decrepit Squat
It's been inhabited by the homeless since long before the war. They've always been struggling with the lack of food and might not have survived the recent shortages. They shouldn't be a threat and we could find some useful things there.
It was a ruin before the war. Now half of the city looks like this.
The letter says: </n></n>"Dearest Masha. I found shelter among the homeless. I am no longer a teacher or an artist - I am one of them now. There is not much food, so some of my friends already left us. But do not be worried, I too will seek more appropriate refuge as soon as I've finished my painting."
Someone probably painted this picture recently. There are rich-looking people sitting together in a littered, ruined building. A metaphor of some sort, I believe.
Brothel
If you want to get laid for a can of meat, this is the place. Mothers will do some really kinky stuff to get food for their children. It's a big building, well guarded by local thugs. They have plenty of goods and are eager to trade.
It's my first time in this kind of place.
It's trash, mostly. Among it lie a fashionable handbag, torn as if someone had ripped it open, not sparing any thought to a damaged zipper, a tiny framed photo of a young man, and a pocket notebook. Whoever tossed these here wasn't their owner.
Shelled School
The school has been shelled several times. Unfortunately, most of the cellars have collapsed so it might be a good idea to bring a shovel and maybe some other tools. They say some homeless people have taken refuge inside the building.
I heard they had classes when the shelling started. Poor kids...
I found a letter:</n></n>"Mom, it's terrible! A girl I knew was shot today by a man called Sniper! I can't believe I won't see her again. She was such a kind girl, what did she do to this Sniper? They turned off the electricity and the teacher said we would have to stay in school a little longer today. I don't know why, I want to see you and dad already. At least they promised to bring you this letter. Will you come and take me home?"
It's a note left for someone: </n></n>"I prepared this secret stash behind the fridge, like you asked. I already put some stuff there so you can see if it works for you."
There are a lot of propaganda leaflets. On one of them there's a symbol of a plane symbol and a message: </n></n>"DO NOT APPROACH INTERNATIONAL AID DROPS. IT MAY BE DANGEROUS. REPORT ALL DROPS TO THE NEAREST MILITIA OUTPOST!"
Seems that they are storing propaganda leaflets here. There are plenty in the boxes and on the floor.
This school was damaged by mortar shells. No classes held for a long time. Recently a group of rebel militiamen moved into the abandoned building. They might be willing to trade with us.
Warehouse
This used to be a warehouse of a big store. Currently it's used as a hideout by a group of armed thugs. We might find useful things there if we can sneak in, but it is very dangerous.
They've seen some armed individuals here, I'd better be careful...
Someone wrote on the wall:</n></n>"We have to go find Lena. We'll be at the market every day at noon. </n>S+D"
Ruined Villa
They say some people still live there, against all odds. They must have some supplies stocked, like canned food and possibly bandages or medicines, but they don't want to trade. If we're desperate, we could try to steal from them.
It's an old villa in a rich neighborhood. People say some deserters from the army chose it for their hideout. They might be dangerous and suspicious of strangers, but they probably have lots of supplies stocked, like military rations of canned food.
They're lucky to stay in their own house despite the devastation.
It can be very dangerous. Deserters are not disciplined soldiers.
A black and white picture of the owner's wife surrounded by burning candles. Did she pass away? I hope it was before the war and she was lucky not to be part of it.
It's some woman's diary. She writes a lot about a man called Emil. Apparently, he owns this house and she made friends with him while treating his wounds. After she moved in, he began to reconcile with his wife's death. At least these two found some consolation in this mess...
This must have been the owner of the house. Poor guy. It seems he starved to death.
It seems to be a ransom note: </n></n>"We've got your son locked up in his house. If you try to take the place, we'll kill him. If you don't bring the money, we'll kill him slowly. So you better hurry. Ten thousand or he's dead."
Semi-Detached House
Half of it is a ruin, but there are people living in the other half. Apparently, they aren't hostile and have a lot of stuff to barter, even food and meds. Let's remember to take something to trade if we're going to pay them a visit.
Half of it is a ruin, but there are people living in the other half. They don't seem friendly - at night you can sometimes hear shots fired from there. We could probably scour the abandoned part for supplies if we manage to sneak past the inhabited part.
The destruction is unimaginable. It's a miracle the other part still stands.
This is the part where the shots were coming from, I'd better be careful.
A note:</n></n>"There's a hollow wall in the basement. Please, hide some supplies there in case we have to come back."
The crude letters on the wall reads:</n></n>"Hana, Tomas and me moved in with uncle Radu. We buried mom in the yard. Take care daddy.</n>Petra"
Military Outpost
Those who aim at each other during the day, often trade with each other at night. These soldiers have a lot of goods and they're willing to trade, especially for alcohol or cigarettes, but be careful, you never know what to expect from them.
I've lost track who's side they are on.
The first page from a letter:</n></n>“Mother told me you're thinking about joining the military. I have a story for you. Last week we caught a rebel girl - a sniper. The guys told me she had killed some kid, so they wanted to have a little fun with her. They tied her to a tree with explosives all over her. The fuse was long enough to give her time to reconsider her life."
The second page from a letter:</n></n>"It took about ten minutes before she blew up. You know what’s the worst part? Not the guts and the blood. The look on her face. Her face is like burnt into the back on my skull. I don't think it'll ever go away. You wanna seek some adventure in the military, right? I found none, brother. Only death and dirt.”
Hotel
A small yet luxurious hotel, previously owned by Pogoren Travel Agency. Presently occupied by some armed thugs. Screams are sometimes heard coming from the building. It's best to keep away from it.
Once noble and bright, now a shadow of its former self. Like us.
These bodies... they are horribly mangled. These wounds were inflicted with extreme cruelty... Whoever did this must have been a deranged psychopath...
There is a note scraped on the wall:</n></n>"Every night I hear screams. I can't take it much longer. I dread the moment when they come for me. God save me, please!"
Previously owned by Pogoren Travel Agency, this small yet luxurious hotel has long been abandoned. The looters have already taken most of the things of any value, but they could've missed something. Some harmless lunatic is said to be living there for the moment.
Pogoren Travel Agency used to own this small yet luxurious hotel. The owners fled the City just before the siege, along with the foreign journalists who had been staying there. Someone moved in there recently, and spread the news that he was willing to barter. Maybe he has something useful to us?
"Do you want to know how to cheat death? I dug a grave for myself - my old self I mean. He's buried deep in the ground, next to this so-called Hotel. These sacred grounds purify and grant you a new life. One that cannot be seen by The Final Judge."
Construction Site
This abandoned construction site of a luxury residential area, which was to become the jewel of Pogoren, now serves the military snipers as a perfect vantage point, making it a dangerous place to visit. We could find some useful things there, left by construction workers and rebels who held it for some time before they were driven out.
The developer promised the apartments would be finished "no matter what"...
It was supposed to be a luxurious residential area and there was a great hype on apartments there, but the developers fled abroad when the war started. Recently, the military wrested control over this area from the rebels. We could scavenge whatever the rebels left behind, but there is a risk of encountering military patrols.
The stench of decay is unbearable. These bodies must be months old, as they are falling apart. Some have bullet holes in their heads, but no other obvious signs of violence. Are they the rebels killed by the army? Prisoners shot by the rebels? Whoever did this tried to conceal the crime by flooding the basement, maybe they intended to collapse the building and bury evidence under the rubble.
A torn flyer entitled PROCLAMATION reads:</n></n>"...here in our ancient capital Vyseni are at home and will no longer abide the oppression! The Republic of Vysena with its capital in Pogoren and within borders according of the treaty of..." </n></n>Fuck all your treaties and proclamations.
Quiet House
It's in a housing estate that remains almost untouched. It's a calm area of little houses with porches and gardens. Most of those houses are still inhabited - people are trying to lead normal lives there. We've got nothing to look for there, unless we're willing to steal.
When this is over I'm gonna buy myself a house like this.
There's a letter from "Grandpa Bernard" to Alen. </n></n>"We're happy to learn that you've come to like living with auntie. The war is not that bad, it's just not fun for children. In fact, they say it will be over soon, so don't worry about us. Grandma is feeling better. She asked me not to tell you, but she's saving some flour to make you those cookies you like! And as for me... well, I promise you to repair the swing when you are back."
Supermarket
This store supplied the whole neighborhood before the latter turned into a war zone. Since the area is under military control, it might be dangerous to do the groceries there. Still, it might be worth the risk as there should be a lot of goods left.
This supermarket is located in the area remaining under military control, but people are still trying to scavenge it for supplies. We can expect to meet other scavengers there, so it's probably best not to get in their way. Some doors might still be locked, a crowbar could come in handy.
I wonder how much of the supply is left.
I'm not alone here.
A faded leaflet with skull and crossbones reads: </n></n>"DANGER! DO NOT TOUCH UNEXPLODED AMMUNITION! </n>Any weapons, ammunition or equipment left behind or unexploded may be booby-trapped. Do not touch anything. Do not risk severe injury or death. </n>REPORT ANY SUCH FINDS TO THE NEAREST ARMY OUTPOST"
Sniper Junction
Central Square
The city center used to be beautiful, with parks, squares and monuments, surrounded by old buildings. Unfortunately, numerous incidents with civilians shot out there earned it the nickname: 'Sniper Junction'. We may find valuable things there, but it's very risky.
The city center used to be beautiful, with parks, squares and monuments, surrounded by old buildings. The war has taken its toll on the area, but there is a marketplace where people come to barter. We might be able to get the stuff we need, provided we have something to trade.
It used to be such a lively place... I miss those times.
Trade goes on even during the war.
Someone scribbled a note on a page from an old magazine:</n></n>"David, Eva, it's your neighbor Magda. Your baby is safe with me. If you're reading this, try to reach my brother's house (we visited him together last summer, remember?). Good luck."
It's the man we've met before. He must've tried to cross the junction despite his wounds.
St. Mary's Church
St. Mary's Church is still a place of meetings for the local community. Priest Olek is known for his charitable work and offering refuge to the poor. He might have something to give away or trade. The vestry behind the church is devastated and abandoned. We could find some useful materials there.
St. Mary's Church is known for its charitable priest, Olek. Alas, the church has recently been devastated and Olek's fate is unknown. We can expect piles of rubble, so a shovel might come in handy. A group of armed men are said to occupy the vestry building now. Going there might be dangerous.
When I was a child, I would come here with my parents.
There's a mark on the wall, and a few words: </n></n>"Here lies Roxy, the best dog in the world"
City Hospital
It's been shelled several times, there was a fire and numerous bandit raids. And yet, it still operates. Some wards still admit patients and save lives, mostly thanks to doctor Jefimow, a renowned surgeon, who remains steadfast and keeps the others in line.
It's an excerpt from the damage report after one of the shellings: </n></n>"General Surgery - 32 patients. 3 killed, 12 wounded. </n>Neurology - 13 patients. 0 killed, 2 wounded. </n>Children's Ward - 34 patients. 32 killed, 2 wounded. </n>Intensive Care - 55 patients. 9 killed, 10 wounded."</n></n>Seems that the children's ward took the most damage.
They say it still operates. Maybe it's just a rumor?
Looted Gas Station
This was one of the very first places people looted while fleeing from the city. There had been a few hour long ceasefire intended to clean the whole area from civillians, but it was broken. Many people died, though neither side claimed responsibility to this day. Despite heavy shelling of the whole district, the station is in a suprisingly decent shape. It may have been looted, but it might still be worth to check it out.
Looks like people had drained it dry, since it didn't blow up after the shelling
There is a note under the table, not actually hidden, but it could be easily missed. From the style of handwriting you can tell it was written by a woman. In a hurry. </n></n>"Milosz</n>I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I could not wait any longer. I hid some jewelery inside the books. Look for them in the basement, inside carton boxes behind the barred door. Use it. Stay alive. Please.</n></n>God bless you</n>I'm sorry"
This poor man had been caught by the shelling. What was he doing here?
On the fresh grave lies a carefully folded little origami flower and a ID of a man named Milosz
Old Town
The old town used to be a crucible of cultures, with its distinct mix of architectural styles and many great Grazni and Vyseni restaurants and pubs. Military positions in the overlooking mountains make it a dangerous place now, but if we take the risk we might find some supplies there.
Hmm… It looks as though someone reinforced that house, but it seems empty now.
Reinforced door and recent boot prints indicate some people had chosen this building as their refuge, before it was hit by a shell.
Fresh leftovers from a meal suggest someone still lives here.
An unsent letter.</n></n>Dear Mother,</n>We’re all living under a lot of stress, but it seems Robert can’t cope with it anymore. His mind is breaking under the pressure. He’s becoming violent. Today he was very harsh with Tatiana, only because she drank one glass of water more than was her share. I’m afraid war might change him even further.</n></n>I’m not sure I can rely on him anymore. We’ll try to leave the city. I’ve already made some arrangements. Love, Nadia
Robert, </n>My dear brother, by the time you read this, we will have already gone. I know how much this house means to you, but we can’t go on living like this! Snipers, bandits, and now this explosion! I can’t convince you to leave, but you must understand I have to protect my little girl.</n></n>I’m leaving you some supplies in the box under the kitchen sink. You’ll also find some documents hidden under the stairs. They will help you leave the city if you decide to join us. Be safe. Nadia

You can have it almost for nothing.
It's quite common, being honest.
It would cost you...
You'd have to show me A LOT in exchange.
Very common stuff, not very interesting.
Nothing special, but not bad either.
I don't need that.
Interesting. Wanna exchange?
Exactly what I need! I can give you a lot for this!
You've gotta be kidding. Show me some more.
It won't do, try harder.
Fine, we can have a deal.
It's very generous of you.
This offer of yours is just too damn impressive.
It wasn't easy to get here. I hope you'll appreciate that.
It's tough, but neighbors should help each other.
Let's cut to the chase and trade.
Show me what you wish to trade.
What can you give me for that?
What do you want for this?
Please... I'm so hungry...
If I don't eat something... I don't know how long can I hold on...
Do you have some food? I'm very hungry.
It's very interesting but has no value for me...
Please, I'd be so grateful if I could have it...
You are a good person.
It's so much... Are you sure there will be enough left for you too?
We're leaving soon, I need supplies for my family.
The situation is uncertain, we may need to defend ourselves.
It's not easy to get firearms, do you have some to trade?
Just shut up and trade.
This is the place to get the good stuff. Or to get laid.
Y'know how's life, we've gotta cope somehow.
Hey, if you got smokes or booze, we'll make a deal. But don't try anything funny!
Hey, you have something for trade, right? If not, beat it!
We've got lot's of stuff to trade, but we lack booze and smokes. Got some?
Hello, let's trade!
I've got metal parts, scrap, whatever you need!
Only finest wares. Check them out!
Luxury goods! Best quality!
Spirit, coffee, cigarettes! Got it all!
Grab them fast, while supplies last!
Hungry? What are you waiting for?
Canned meat, fresh meat, vegetables, you name it!
Get your food here. Good prices!
I've got medical supplies, get them while they're available.
You don't look so well, but I sure as hell have something to fix it.
Trust me, I used to be a nurse. I know my trade.
Welcome to the house of God. We are a peaceful community here.
Will you be so kind as to help the poor in time of hardship?
Welcome! If you support the Vyseni liberation uprising, we can trade.
We need guns and ammo most of all. What've you got?
You can back our cause and profit at the same time!
You need electrical appliances? Look no further!
Got some really rare things, have a look!
Let's make a deal, you won't regret it!
Hello, let's barter!
Come on, take a look at my wares.
I'm sure I've got what you need!
Gimme your smokes, trust me you don’t wanna piss me off!
You’re a cool {mr|guy}{fr|gal}!
You’re lucky!
Give me those smokes you {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}!
Hand over the smokes or you’re dead!
Give me something to smoke or else!
Just what I need, hand it over!
Again, we mostly need medicines, bandages, and alcohol.
Our resources are modest, but we have some things to exchange.
This is very common, a symbolic contribution would be enough.
This? Surprisingly, we acquire it quite easily.
You would have to offer us significant help.
Oh, you need to make an extraordinary donation to receive it.
This is something you wish to donate to the hospital...? Really?
We can accept it, but we'd prefer medications or bandages.
We won't need that.
This will be useful for our patients.
Exactly what we need. If you donate it, we can save more lives.
Don't be ridiculous. Offer us something useful or leave.
If you're into this kind of trade, you've come to a wrong place. Offer us more.
Sure, it's an honest exchange. Not necessarily an expected donation...
That's an offer I'd expect from a decent person!
It'd be such a generous donation... I hope you won't change your mind.
Do you want to make a donation to the hospital?
Show me how you want to help us.
You can choose something for exchange... or just help the hospital.
Everyone should choose one happy memory. And it can’t just be good, it has to be grand. When it gets so bad you just want to sit down and cry, when your life seems forfeit, you close your eyes and go back to your happy moment. It’s not easy, but you have to try.
My father told me that I should choose one happy memory. And when the life becomes miserable, I just have to close my eyes and go back to that happy moment. But what do you do when your happiest memory brings you nothing but pain?
We were called to a tenement fire. I was still the new one on our team. We just started assembling the hoses, when a resident shouted that there was someone inside. I donned the mask, went in and carried out a young lady. Long story short, we got married soon after. Her name was Alina.
My happiest moment is a memory of a fire. I was a new addition to our team and guys used to tease me, calling me names, but it was a friendly ribbing. Long story short, we were called to a tenement fire and I got lucky, rescued a young lady and became the old hand right there. And that lady, Alina was her name, became my wife soon after.
Alina gave me two beautiful girls. We were so happy. When the war broke out, we decided they would be safer at my mother’s house in the country. I stayed with my team to help people. We thought all this would be over in a couple of weeks. It’s been almost three years now. Phones are dead, so I’ve been sending letters through anyone leaving the city.
We had two kids, two beautiful daughters. When the war started, she took them and moved to the country, to my mother. She wanted me to come but I’d never leave my team in times like these. We had a lot of fires to fight. Then, there were more fires than we could fight... and later on the team was no more. It turned out I couldn’t leave the city.
I’ve got no reply yet and I’m really worried. But I have to trust that Alina and the girls are fine and that everything is going to be alright, or I’ll go mad. When this siege is over, I'll find them no matter what and I won't let anything separate us ever again. I hope that one day we can forget this war ever happened and think of it as just a bad dream.
I've had no word from them for months now. There is no way to reach them, no phones, no mail, I’ve tried to give letters to strangers, but haven’t heard back. I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever see my Alina and my daughters alive. And this slowly drives me crazy. I wish I could get my hands on whoever started this madness.
After the war, Marko found his family, who managed to avoid the worst atrocities hidden away by a friendly country family. They came back to Pogoren along with other people. Normalcy returned to the city. Buildings were rebuilt. Schools and shops reopened. Life went on.
After the war, Marko set out to find his family. The refugees from the city had been brutally persecuted. Alina and the girls survived, but what they went through scarred them forever. Marko never spoke of the horrors he'd witnessed, either. Would life ever be normal again?
After the war, Marko set out to find his family. The refugees from the city had been brutally persecuted. There was no trace of Alina or the girls. Marko hoped against the odds they did not end up in one of the many mass graves scarring the countryside. Would he ever see them again?
For all his efforts Marko was rewarded with a shallow grave. Maybe his wife and daughters will find it someday, on condition that they managed to survive the persecutions themselves.
It was a tough decision but there were reasons why Marko could not stay in the shelter.
Marko slipped out of the shelter one night, leaving no notes behind. He died, betrayed by a smuggler, while trying to reach his family.
Broken, Marko lost all hope of ever reaching his wife and daughters. Along with hope, he also lost his will to live on. He left them a goodbye letter, but no one passed it on to them.
I thought I'd been through hell before. I'm a fireman. I’ve entered blazing buildings to save lives more times than I care to remember. But back then I had people teamed up against a common foe, namely the fire. Nowadays, your former neighbor can kill you because your grandparents spoke a different language than his. This is true hell on earth.
Sorry to disturb you, funny how life turns out. I'm a fireman, I've been saving people all my life. Now I'm the one that needs saving. My family fled to the country. I wanted to go to them, but the city got encircled and I couldn't. Will you let me stay with you?
It’s Marko’s body. He used to save people’s lives and now he lies dead and abandoned. He deserved better.
People treasure their possessions now. In the past, they just tossed out anything that broke. I had a hard time living off my workshop, customers were dropping by once or twice a day, mostly like that old lady who had been using the same iron since she was a young bride and the world was brighter... But there were exceptions.
People value their things now. And they used to dump all that broke into the trash! I ran a repair business, but I couldn't make a good living with just a couple customers a day. Mostly old women who would use the same meat grinder all their life if only they could. Not that I complain. Wouldn't see much business otherwise.
One day a little boy brought his action figure with a broken arm. You can't glue that kind of plastic. Oh my, I said, this is serious, and his eyes welled up and I had no heart to turn him down, so I just told him to return the next day. I fixed it - trade secret - and when he saw it, his smile lit up the whole room. I don't know what became of him. The toy I found in the street after all went to hell.
One day a kid brought an action figure with a broken arm. They make them from plastic that can't be glued. And there are no spare parts. All on purpose, to sell more new toys. But I fixed it anyway! And gave it back to the boy. Oh, how happy he was. Later, after everything went to hell, I found his toy in the street. And I knew... I knew he wouldn't part with it for his life.
I was asked to make a set of burglary tools. I refused. Money was good, but I wanted none of it. I wish I knew those customers wouldn't take 'no' for an answer. They came for me when I was upstairs with my wife, fast asleep. I figure they couldn't force the shop door, so they just tossed a Molotov through the window. Our bedroom window.
I was asked to make a set of burglary tools. I refused. Money was good, but I wanted none of it. I should have taken the job. </n>When the thugs came for me, we... I was upstairs, fast asleep, and the shop door was locked. I know my doors and my locks, so they just tossed a Molotov through the bedroom window.
I don't even know how I escaped. My wife didn't. All I cared about was burned to the ground. Every now and then I think about that boy. Where is he now? What is he doing? Is he still alive? If he is, I'm gonna find him one day. I'm sure he misses his toy.
The flames were everywhere. I grabbed the sheets and tried to, tried to, you know. Smother the fire. But her hair - everything was burning. Everything was burned down. I escaped. I don't know how. I wish I had taken that job.
Surviving the war, Marin set about finding the boy who once brightened his day. His efforts proved futile so he rebuilt his house and kept the action figure in the shop window.</n>And one winter afternoon, the entrance bell rang and the familiar smile has once again filled Marin's workshop - and his life - with light.
Marin cheated death again and saw the end of fighting. Although he remained plagued by the survivor's guilt, he set about rebuilding his life and soon he was running a small repair business, again. He kept the action figure on his workbench but never found the courage to look for its previous owner.
Marin survived, but scarred for life, and not just physically. He opened a small repair business in a rented basement, sleeping under the workbench. Soon, he was booted out for lagging with his rent as he kept spending all income on booze. He died in a hospice of liver failure.
These hardened hands will never again make anything right; neither for Marin, nor for anyone else. The tragic story of this man came to an end. Maybe he finally found peace.
Marin had to seek luck elsewhere, however useful he might have turned out to be.
One night, Marin left the shelter, taking the action figure he had mentioned with him. He disappeared without a trace.
Having lost everything, overcome by grief and remorse, Marin committed suicide. He was buried in a shallow grave like so many other victims of war.
Something broke? I can fix it. Any worthless trash lying around? I can make plenty of useful stuff out of junk. And I don't waste material - all of them... parts, bits of wood, plastic pipes... and all the other... things. I know how to make tools, furniture, stoves, heaters, whatever. Given enough time, I can make this place look almost like a proper home. I wish it was equally simple with mine.
My name is Marin. I ran a repair workshop, but it was burned down. I have nothing to go back to... Maybe I could stay here with you? I'm handy with all kinds of tools. If you have some junk lying around, I could use it to make this place more habitable.
Marin’s body… There’s no time to bury him now, but I’ll remember this place. Maybe after the fighting is over, I’ll come back here.
I was at the front line since the shit got serious. My unit was always the first to go in and the last to get out. After I lost a quarter of my men, the elders decided we needed some R&R. That's how I wound up in Pogoren, where all was quiet. It was not to last.
Ever since the fighting started, I was in the thick of it with my unit. The assholes from the HQ let us rest only when a quarter of my people were dead. And they sent us to Pogoren of all places, where soon the carnage was worse than at the front line.
The battle for Pogoren was short and ugly. When the man in the street can turn out to be the enemy, people start... taking precautions. Like shooting anyone who looks at them funny. I'm not saying I did that, but I was the minority.
The worst thing about the fights in Pogoren was that you never knew if the man whom you passed in the street wasn't working for the enemy. So I told my men to be extra suspicious. Better to shoot one more guy than let the fucker turn around and stab you in the back.
After we finished carving up the city between ourselves and the enemy, things got even uglier. Entire groups of civilians were brought in for questioning and much too often shot so as not to leave witnesses behind, I guess. I wanted no part of that. I'm a fighter, not a murderer.
After the borders between our turf and the enemy's were more or less stable, things got even uglier. Entire groups were rounded up and some people shot after having been interrogated. One day we were ordered to dispose of a bunch of such poor bastards. I recognized one of them. It was Leon, my best childhood buddy. I aimed over their heads. Others didn't.
One night I changed into my old garb and just walked away. My mate was on duty, I told him I'm off to get some ass and I'd be back by dawn. I hope he didn't catch too much shit for letting me through.
After that, I couldn't look my people in the face. I wanted to kill them, or kill myself, or blow up the whole compound. I ended up just running away one night. </n>I have no idea what I'll say if I ever meet them. I don't know if I was too weak, or if they were.
After the war, Roman sought out his former buddies and much to his great relief learnt that most of them admired his courage and the decision he made. He returned to his neighborhood and became a leader of the local community.
Roman survived the war but avoided his old haunts, anxious to meet former comrades. He settled in the country and tried to start a new life, but remained haunted by his past.
Roman survived the war. Tortured by his past, he started doing hard drugs and a few years later died of drug-related health problems.
As so many other tough-as-nails guys, Roman didn't make it. His motivations will remain unknown to his buddies, and some of them still think he betrayed them.
Roman had to seek shelter elsewhere. His military background was deemed more of a problem than an asset.
Roman disappeared from the shelter one night, leaving no note. He survived the war but was soon arrested for murder and sentenced to fifteen years in prison.
Unable to accept the reality in which he had to live, hating himself for not being stronger and more in control of his life, Roman killed himself. He left no notes or goodbye letters.
I never thought I'd end up running and hiding from my buddies. But that's how things turned out. We were like brothers, and now I'm a dead man to them. My crew had ruled the 'hood since we were teens until just before the war. Then some of us got drafted, like my best friend Leon, others like me volunteered for the militia. It was going to be the ultimate showdown and every single one of us wanted a piece of the action.
Thanks for opening the door. I'm looking for a place to hide away for some time. I was drafted by the rebels, but I didn't want to kill my brothers, so I ran away at first opportunity. If they catch me, I'm dead. Let me stay with you!
Roman was the toughest among us, but that wasn’t enough. What chances do I stand without him?
I had a beautiful girlfriend, Ana. We had a kid. A wonderful son. Luka was just like me, he was only seven and already stronger than all the other kids. I bet he would've grown up to become a great weightlifter, as I always wanted to be. If I had saved him.
I had a beautiful girlfriend, Ana. We had a kid. His name was Luka. He was going to be just as strong as me. But she used to pamper him too much. Boys should be brought up tough or they'll turn out soft. Or worse.
When we were hiding in the basement, after they hit our house, we quickly ran out of food and had very little water. I could not move much because of my foot, Ana saved us both. She was a great mother, a real hero. Ana used to go out at night and she was bringing us everything we needed.
My house was hit and we had to live in the basement. We were hungry, we had very little water. I couldn't do anything, my foot was crushed, and I felt so useless. Ana kept disappearing every night and as I lay there in pain, with Luka in my arms, I couldn't help wondering where she was getting the food she was bringing us.
Ana was a terrific mother. She'd do anything for Luka. I mean, she did, when he got the runs from bad water he drank. Soon he was weakening by the hour, so she went to get him the medicine. "You stay here, you can barely walk, and I'll run like the wind", she told me. But you can't outrun a sniper's bullet.
One day Luka fell ill with the runs, turned out he'd drunk water from a puddle. "I'm sorry daddy, I ate peanuts and I was terribly thirsty". Salted peanuts. This is not proper food for a child. Soon, he was getting weaker by the hour. Ana said she'd get him meds. She must've felt guilty for she didn't bother to wait for the sunset before she went out.
A stranger came to our basement. He told me that Ana had been shot on the way back. He brought the meds, but it was too late for my poor son. "Don't cry daddy, I'll be fine now! And mum promised to bring us something nice", said Luka shortly before dying. I didn't tell him she was gone. I would give everything to bring them back. I'll always love them.
On the night of Luka's death some guy appeared out of nowhere and said that he was Ana's friend and that she had asked him to bring us the medicine. But it was too late for Luka. Before leaving, this guy said that Ana had been shot by a sniper... but I will always wonder if she didn't just choose a better life over us.
Boris won over everything that war threw at him and used his grit and strength to help others rebuild their lives. The memory of Ana's sacrifice and Luka's faith supported him till the end of his days.
Boris managed to see the end of war and tried to put his life back together, mostly to no avail. The memory of his son's and girlfriend's fate haunted him till the end of his days.
While Boris survived the war, he grew increasingly hateful towards others and spent several years on futile search for the sniper who shot Ana. He died from the injuries suffered in drunken altercation with a man he accused of being her killer.
Luck has finally abandoned Boris, not much of a surprise for him. His strength was not enough to keep him alive. In a just universe, he'd be with his son now.
We decided that we couldn't accept Boris after all. Let's hope he had better luck elsewhere.
Boris disappeared one night without a trace. He died of liver failure a few years after the war.
Boris couldn't take it anymore and took his own life, haunted by the memory son's and girlfriend's fate. Maybe he is reunited with them now.
I'm not big with words. I'm just a regular guy, I used to stack stuff on the night shift at a warehouse, by hand mostly. It was tough work but I was always strong, even when I was a kid. Now this place is gone, shelled to hell, and so is my house. My foot was crushed under the rubble. It has healed, but it's still a bit stiff, so I can't run very fast. But I can carry more than anyone I know.
My neighborhood got shelled while I was working on a night shift at a local warehouse. I helped clear the rubble and get the survivors out, but we couldn't save everyone... When I got home I found it in ruins. Can I stay with you for some time? Looks to me you could use a pair of strong hands.
Poor Boris… He really was an unhappy man. Maybe it’s better for him that way. Still, I will miss him.
I told you about my old man - I hated that asshole... But war does things to people. That night, when the bombs fell on Gravia, something changed. What he did… I’ll never forget it. You heard what they did in Gravia, right?
I made it all the way from Gravia to Pogoren, and for what? More shelling, more bloodshed. Maybe it would've been better if I'd died there and then. You heard what the Grazni did in Gravia?
On that night I got a shrapnel in my thigh. The army entered the city and indiscriminately started slaughtering rebels and civilians. We had to scram and I couldn't even rise from my bed. So I was just lying there, waiting for death to come. I was hoping the old drunk would save himself, not stay with me till the end. Why worry about something you can't change?
After several hours of bombing the town, the military stormed the city and started slaughtering rebels and civilians like cattle. Wounded by a shrapnel, I couldn't run. Couldn't even walk. I was sure my old man would leave me behind. The asshole never cared about me anyway. Why would he, all of a sudden?
He carried me out of the city. He walked all night. We flowed with a terrified crowd. Father carried me all the way. I have no idea where that old alcoholic found the strength. The day broke and he was still carrying me. When we got here, he just dropped to his knees and died. I will always remember the last words he whispered.
Without saying a word he lifted me up, and started walking. He walked all night like that. Grim, determined, silent. The sun rose and he kept on walking. Where did he even get the strength for that? Beats me. But he carried me all the way to Pogoren. And as soon as we got here, he collapsed to the ground and died. Was it worth it?
He'd always been rough, never said what lay heavily on him, but at that moment he broke. - 'You have to make it, kid' - he said right before he died. - "You gotta be tough, all that's bad will end someday." - He looked at me, pleading. "Like me."
He carried me here and left me alone. We never talked much, he always kept his thoughts to himself. You know what he said right before he died? - "This is the last time anyone ever helped you, kid. You're on your own now."
After the war Arica gave her father a symbolic funeral, and kept his picture. Despite the horrors she witnessed, she managed to start a family and tried to be a better parent than her father had been.
Arica survived the war, though remained mistrustful of others. The horrors she'd witnessed made it difficult for her to find friends. She was afraid of starting a family, not believing she'd make a good parent.
Although Arica survived the war, she found it difficult to adjust to normal life. She did not trust anyone and relied only on herself. Presently, she is serving a sentence for burglary.
Tough girl as she was, Arica died. Harsh reality of living in a ghetto could not be compared to the horrors of war. What would have become of her if she'd survived? We will never know.
We decided that Arica couldn't stay with us. We would be better off without her.
Arica left the shelter without a word. She resurfaced later on as a juvenile gang leader.
Troubled Arica couldn't take it anymore and killed herself. It turns out she was much more sensitive and fragile than she showed.
I'm a simple girl from the hood, and I know life. Street raised me more than my father did. That old sot beat me whenever he felt like it and knew how to make it hurt. That's all over now, he bit the dust in the first days of the war. I've been a cat burglar since I turned 14, you know how it is. I'm better at it than anyone you know and I can sneak like a fox. You'd be a fool kicking me out.
Hey, what's up? Nice place you got here. I'm looking for some place to lay low for a while. I used to live in a large block of flats till it got shelled. Here's the deal: you let me stay here, I help you out. I can move as quiet as a cat.
Arica claimed to be as quiet as a cat, or was it a fox? Anyway, apparently that wasn’t enough to save her.
I used to be an optimist - one of those people who'd have sworn that war wouldn't come. Wars happened far away, in third-world countries. Or so I thought. Even when I was listening to the news getting scarier day by day, I did not believe all that was about to happen.
People are fools, but I was their king. I used to think that whatever our differences, we won't just start shooting each other one day. That it's something... other peoples do. Not us! We lived together for centuries, we are a civilized nation. Stupidity is lethal. Mine probably killed my dearest friend.
I have a dearest friend who always worried a lot. One day she called me, terrified, saying there was a riot outside, the secessionists were inciting the crowd to burn the town hall. I told her not to worry. And I was right! Nothing came of it - this time. But even when the riots and fights became everyday news, I kept assuring her it would all blow over soon.
I answered the phone one day, and it was my friend, incoherent, crying that there was a crowd outside her house and how they were going to burn everything and she had to flee the country. I calmed her as well as I could - fortunately, the crowd dispersed soon - and I kept soothing her fears in the coming weeks. Did a really good job with that. She decided to stay.
I have a house just outside the city and ride a bus to work. One day I was in my restaurant here in Pogoren, not really noticing the muted TV showing some scenes of heavy fighting - and suddenly I recognized the location. It was my town. My friend was there. With pounding heart, I grabbed my coat and rushed towards the sounds of gunfire.
I was in my restaurant, watching the patrons argue over their dinner and not really noticing the news showing some heavy fighting, when it hit me: they're showing Pogoren outskirts! It's my town! Where my friend lives! I don't know what I was hoping for when I rushed out the door and to the bus station.
At the bus station I learnt from the other commuters that we were under siege, and no bus towards my town would leave. I was shattered. If it wasn't for me, my friend would've left the town and gone abroad to her aunt. But I convinced her to stay. And now... Now I don't know if she's well, I haven't heard from her ever since the siege began...
It was too late. The siege was on, we were already cut off, all rides to my town were cancelled. And it was also too late to do anything for my friend, anyway. I should've had thought about that before I lulled her into a false sense of security. I don't know what happened to her. Most likely I'll never learn, but I fear the worst.
After the ceasefire Bruno set off looking for his friend. Her neighborhood saw heavy fighting and the majority of housing had been reduced to ruins, but she found shelter in the basement which somehow held. Despite the hardships she managed to survive and was happy to see Bruno alive as well. They remain friends to this day.
After the ceasefire Bruno went looking for his friend. Her neighborhood saw heavy fighting, and most of the houses had been reduced to ruins, but she found shelter in the basement which held. Eating rats and scavenged scraps of food, she somehow managed to survive. Bruno felt responsible for her misery. He has never forgiven himself.
After the ceasefire Bruno went looking for his friend. Her neighborhood witnessed heavy fighting, and most of the houses had been reduced to ruins. She was nowhere to be found and her former neighbors did not know what had happened to her. Bruno never saw her again.
Despite his valiant struggle, Bruno didn't make it through the war. The fate of his friend he was worried about remains unknown.
Bruno was denied refuge in the shelter. His fate beyond that day remains unknown.
Bruno left the shelter one night. He was trying to reach his friend and got shot while attempting to slip between army pickets.
After having lost all hope, Bruno tied the noose around his neck. His last thoughts were of his lost friend, and of what could have been but wasn't meant to be.
Before the war I used to own a restaurant. I even had my own TV show: "Bruno's Cuisine", I'm sure you've seen it. I visited beautiful places where I was filmed cooking exquisite dishes. All that seems of no importance now, don't you think? Nowadays, you're lucky if you get your hands on some canned meat or a bag of rice. And who knows how long this war is going to last.
Ok, I won't lie to you, I'm looking for a place to stay until this madness is over. Before the war I was a chef, I even had my own TV programme for some time. Now I'm penniless and homeless. If you let me stay, I can cook for all of us.
Maybe Bruno wasn’t the kindest person I knew, but we were in this together and now he’s dead…
I'm so glad to be here. I apologize for my introductory tirade. But this war has taken a heavy toll on my mind. Some people who are... who were very dear to my heart gave me an order to stay alive at all costs. And since I owe them my life, it's no longer mine to throw away.
It's good to live under a roof, if a leaky one. I apologize for my tirade. But please understand, I was planning to walk out on the street in broad daylight and wait for the bullet, had I been alone a day longer. After all I that saw I'm just tired of trying to stay alive.
I was factually precise about my status in the academia. I was nominated for the Fields Medal once - it's like the Nobel Prize in mathematics. I'm... I used to teach and enjoyed it quite a lot. </n>This, in turn, is in a way responsible for the impact the war had on me. I was trying to protect my brightest students for months, only to become a witness to them being killed ruthlessly.
I used to teach young people mathematics. It's hard to find more useless skill to have in times like these. But I know how to set a trap and cook a rat! Not a day without learning something, as I used to say to my students. They are all gone... slaughtered like cattle, or worse, for you don't terrorize animals before slaughter. It spoils the taste.
After the destruction of the campus, I hid with my students in abandoned houses on the riverfront. We managed to survive there for a while, hunting rats for food. We punched passages in the basement walls to move from house to house safely, as the shelling and snipers were unrelenting. But the damp darkness and constant fear of being buried alive drove some brilliant minds into insanity.
After the destruction of the university, we ran and hid. We lived in basements for endless months. We crawled through dark passages and hunted vermin to delay starvation. I saw my pupils go mad from fear, lack of hope, and deprivation. We huddled together in cellars like worms under a stone, listening to the roar of explosions, waiting for the merciful death.
The army swept through the neighborhood, going from cellar to cellar, pulling people out, shooting some on the spot, the young men especially, as "terrorist supporters". The girls were taken away. My students covered me with mattresses and ordered me to stay put. "Please, this once, professor, you must listen to us", they said. I didn't find it in me to protest.
Finally, the army came and swept us from our hiding holes like rats. My best student Niko, who was supposed to be in Oxford this spring, was shot as a "terrorist supporter". The cries of girls being taken away will always ring in my ears. It is the cruelest irony to be the only survivor when everyone I vowed to nurture and protect is gone.
While war left deep marks on Anton's character, he returned to teaching with newfound determination. And while too old for the Fields Medal, he's still eligible for the equally prestigious Abel Prize.
Anton managed to stay alive but war scarred him for life. He never again found the courage to attach emotionally to anyone and devoted himself entirely to the pursuit of abstract knowledge.
After the war, Anton put his brilliant mind to the singular task of ensuring his own safety. He left the country and the pursuit of knowledge. He works now as an analyst for a large investment bank.
Anton will never get his award. Despite his students' sacrifice, he did not manage to survive. The theorems he could prove, the students he could lead and inspire – all gone.
It's a pity but Anton had to seek shelter elsewhere. Who needs a scientist when we can die tomorrow?
One night, Anton waited patiently for the right moment and slipped out the door unnoticed. His further fate is unknown.
Even great minds can break under pressure. Consumed by guilt, Anton chose to take his own life. The sacrifice of his students was in vain.
I've been running into either insufferable rubes or outright criminals. But I feel that you're different! And for a scientist with an established position like me, the company of people of comparable mental capacity is paramount. Besides... ah, bloody hell, I can't stand faking it anymore! I'm just an old fart who knows nothing. I'm so grateful for your company. I've been out there alone for too long. Way too long.
Good day, my name's Anton. Forgive me this intrusion... You see, I am not so young anymore, and frankly I don't think I can survive this war on my own. Would you be so kind as to let me stay with you? I promise I'll work to earn my keep!
Maybe he was a famous mathematician, but for me he was a good companion. We were in this together, and now he’s dead.
We lived in an expansive villa, with spacious bright rooms and large windows. To protect ourselves from stray bullets and splinters, we installed a double bed and a small heater in a cozy dressing room on the ground floor. We spent most of our time there, talking, reading, listening to music and playing games to stave off boredom.
We lived in a large standalone house, whose spacious bright rooms with large windows became uninhabitable due to constant shooting and shelling. That is why we confined ourselves to one windowless dressing room on the ground floor which could hardly fit one double bed and a small heater. We spent most of our time there, going out only to the toilet.
When the banks closed, father opened the safe box and pulled out a small chest. "Cheer up, girls", he said, "we aren't broke yet!" Then he went to the marketplace and brought back fresh peaches. He kept trading jewelry for food every day. We also received humanitarian aid, like everybody else. So it wasn't bad, apart from the isolation. But father wanted us to be safe.
Father went to the marketplace every day to barter our deceased mother's valuables for food and other necessities. He also took humanitarian aid, though it must have been humiliating for him. My sister and I hardly went out at all. He wanted to keep us safe. Because we had long hair and no running water, we started having problems with lice.
One day father was unwell, so I went to the market instead. I was happy to finally be out in the open. I had the safe route memorized, so I made the trip safely. But coming back, I saw a column of smoke over our street. Our house was on fire. I couldn't get inside, the smoke was too thick. I went around to the garden entrance and there I found them.
One day father fell ill, so I had to go to the market. My fears proved unfounded, as nothing bad happened to me on the way. But when I was coming home, I saw smoke over our street. Our house was on fire. I couldn't get inside, the smoke was too thick. Dreading the worst, I started calling my father and sister. Nobody answered. Then I found them in the backyard.
My father and sister were shot dead. Some ragtag militiamen entered the house claiming they were looking for enemy informants. They took my father and sister to the garden and shot them. The neighbors said that they didn't even bother to interrogate anyone. Instead, they had cleaned the house of anything valuable.
My father and sister were dead. The neighbors told me that the militia members entered the house claiming they were looking for Grazni informants. They interrogated and killed my family and before setting fire to the house, they took everything valuable that was still there. I'm sure it was the real reason for their visit.
After the war Emilia became a public prosecutor in Pogoren. She used her law expertise in trials of war criminals who were brought to justice. She has never found out who the murderers of her family were, but deep inside she hopes they got what they deserved.
After the war Emilia wanted to forget, so she left Pogoren and went to the USA where she joined a law firm. She makes good money - her father would be proud. However, she's troubled by waking nightmares and has developed hatred towards men.
Emilia survived the war, but it has left its mark on her. She was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. She had developed anxiety and hatred towards men. She opened her private legal advice office, but hasn't been doing particularly well.
Emilia was refused refuge in the shelter. She was very determined to survive, so she might still have made it.
Emilia joined the long list of casualties of this destructive conflict. The fact that she was young and well-off didn’t matter. War makes everyone equal.
One night, Emilia took off alone and unnoticed. Unlikely as it might sound, she surfaced years after the war as a corporate lawyer abroad.
Broken by the horrors of war Emilia slit her wrists. As the blood flowed from her veins, she thought about her murdered sister and father. She would see them again, soon.
Now that we're stuck together, I might as well tell you about me and my family. Father was a very practical man. He always reminded us of the importance of financial safety. That's why I became a lawyer like him, and my sister was to become a doctor. When the war broke out, we had a lot of savings on our family account. But the currency soon lost all value, the banks were closed and we had no foreign cash. In a matter of days we became poor.
Excuse me for this intrusion... I'm really embarrassed to ask this of you, but... would you let me stay with you for some time? I can't go home, I tried to stay in my law office, but that area has recently become very dangerous... I really have nowhere to go...
Maybe she was a talented lawyer, but it did her no good. It doesn’t matter who you are, war makes everyone equal.
All this shelling, sniper fire, and lack of supplies makes you want to hide away, sit down and cry. But we cannot let them crush our spirit, we have to show them that they can't take away our dignity. It's difficult here, but you know how we did it on our street?
All this shelling, sniper fire, and lack of supplies makes you want to hide away, sit down and cry. It's hopeless. When the buildings on my street were still standing, we were trying to preserve our dignity, but did we manage to?
It was tough, but women living in our street took great care to look beautiful. They were always clean and wore their best clothes. That was a sight, I tell you. Lining up for water, they looked as if they were waiting to visit a theatre. And my boy came up with another idea.
Women from our street took great care to look beautiful. They were always clean, wearing their best clothes, despite the terrible conditions. We tried so hard, but it was all in vain. Only kids still had some hope left... you know what my boy did?
You just can't lock kids inside with nothing to do. Life will find its way. So my boy formed a football team. They trained in a dark basement. They were so committed and came up with an idea to organize a Pogoren cup. We invited three other teams, but there was a significant problem we had to overcome.
You just can't lock kids inside with nothing to do, so my boy formed a football team. It was heartbreaking to watch them train in a dark basement. They came up with an idea to organize a Pogoren cup. Even though I was terrified, we invited three other teams. We had a very serious problem to overcome.
The sports hall survived the shelling, but to get there we needed to cross the bridge under Grazni sniper fire. The Peacekeepers refused to help us with their armored transports, so we waited for a foggy night and just made a wild run for it. We made it safe. There weren't many spectators, but it was still the most memorable football cup of my life... My boy was so happy. Next day, my wife managed to escape with him abroad. I'll see them again when this is over.
The sports hall survived the shelling, but to get there we needed to cross the bridge under Grazni sniper fire. The Peacekeepers refused to help us with their armored transports, so one night we just made a wild run for it. We didn't make it. They were just kids! How can anyone shoot at kids? Next day, my wife took him abroad. She was furious. I don't think I'll ever see them again.
Pavle survived the war. After months of searching, despite numerous difficulties, he managed to find his wife and son, who had sought refuge in France. He went there to live with them. They never came back to Pogoren.
Pavle survived the war. He tried to find his wife and son, but despite his best efforts he could not trace them. He decided to stay in Pogoren hoping his son would find him there one day. Years have passed, and he is still waiting.
Pavle survived the war. He tried to find his wife and son, but despite his best efforts he could not trace them. He decided to stay in Pogoren hoping his son would find him there one day. That day never came.
Sadly, Pavle died. Will his family come back to Pogoren to visit his grave one day, or would it be too painful, a reminder of what they had gone through? Do the dead even care?
Pavle was not welcome in the shelter. He was forced to fend for himself.
Pavle decided to leave the shelter one fateful night. The next morning he was shot in the back, running from the bandits.
The only thing that kept Pavle going was the hope of seeing his son again; having lost that hope, Pavle did not want to carry on and committed suicide.
Before this whole mess begun, I lived with my wife and son in the better part of the city. I haven't seen them in a long time, I hope they are ok. I'm not doing so well, as you can see. Who needs football players during war? Nobody cares about sports when every day can be their last. So I scavenge the ruins like everyone else, hoping for the best.
A sniper almost got me.... I thought I was a goner. I ran as fast as I could and that saved me, but it was a close call. I used to play on Pogoren football team, but war put an end to this. My wife and son are abroad, I hope to see them after the war. I have to make it. A boy should have a father. Can I stay here with you until then?
It’s Pavle… At least his son survived. Should he be told that his father is dead? I’ll think about it later.
It's terribly quiet here, don't you think?... Ah, no, of course not, what with all the shooting and bombing, I just mean... This is my job conditioning showing, I'm afraid. You see, I'm a teacher. An elementary school principal.
We could all use some cheering up, don't you think? Let me tell you a story... oh, I'm sorry, this is just my job conditioning showing, I'm afraid. You see, I used to be a teacher. An elementary school principal, if a lousy one.
With the start of the siege, the attendance fell, as many parents chose to keep their kids home. One young man advised me to cover the windows with mattresses from the gym. "That's silly, children need the light to read", I said, "and besides, it's not like anyone is going to target the school!"
When the shooting started, parents were wary of sending their children to school. "What nonsense", I said , "this is the safest place for them". I was so confident that I didn't even cover the windows. Big, beautiful windows letting the light inside for kids to learn in a healthy environment. I was so stupid.
I decided to move the children to the southern classrooms facing the gym and ordered them to sit in the benches away from the windows, just in case. That saved them when a shell fell on the street and all the panes in the northern wall shattered into a hail of glass shards. We covered the windows after that.
Parents were right. Just to appease their fears, I moved the classes to more sheltered rooms. And that saved the children when the army landed a shell right in front of the school - the window panes shattered, but the hail of glass shards fell on empty benches and seats. We covered the windows after that.
One Friday, I got a phone call: "Oh shit, sorry, is this the teacher? It's you! Oh no. Oh no. They told us the school had been evacuated. That there's a rebel outpost there. Get the kids out, now!" I rang the fire alarm and we barely managed to get away. "Why are they trying to kill us?", I heard one girl ask. "They aren't, dearie. It's all a terrible mistake", I answered.
But I was still incredulous that anyone might target the children deliberately. I was wrong again. We had to evacuate in terrible haste, when an anonymous caller told me that the school would be fired upon in minutes. I finally got disillusioned when the shells destroyed my school just as we were running away. "Why are they trying to kill us?", I heard one girl cry. I didn't have an answer. I still don't.
The war didn't extinguish the flame that drove Cveta to give everything to her calling. And one day, she got a visit from a former pupil - the same who made a frantic call one Friday to make sure that his old school had really been evacuated.
With the children returning to school, Cveta couldn't keep herself from getting back to the familiar routine that once again gave a purpose to her life. But she never got rid of the fear for her pupils and of the recurring nightmares.
Cveta saved her own life, but not the internal fire that gave it a purpose. Disillusioned and bitter, she never returned to teaching and withdrew from public life, scraping a living on her meager disability pension.
What answers could have Cveta found for all the difficult questions her pupils would pose, had she lived to see the end of the war? Now the children will have to find them on their own.
We decided that maybe others could make good use of Cveta's abilities. After all, we had no kids to care for, which was probably for the best.
Cveta quietly left the shelter, leaving no word behind. She somehow managed to survive the war, but didn't return to teaching.
Bitter, unable to face the harsh reality of war any longer, Cveta committed suicide. Her students will have to rely on someone else to help them recover from the trauma of war.
Oh dear, that is embarrassing. I know I'm not much of an asset in this terrible situation. I have good administrative and logistical skills, which won't be of any use, given the circumstances. I'm told I'm a good caregiver - I really love kids. What else? I have a driver's license... sorry, that was my poor attempt at a joke.
Thank you for answering the door, people tend to be so mistrustful of others nowadays. I'm Cveta, I used to be a principal of an elementary school. You're probably wondering what the reason of my visit could be... Well, honestly, I'm afraid to be alone in this dreadful situation. Would you mind if I stayed with you? I can take care of any children that might be with you.
I wonder if Cveta would be a good teacher, one that would help children cope with their memories of war. I’ll never find out now.
The army is trying to break the rebels' morale with this incessant bombardment, but it's the civilians like us that suffer the most. When you've been under fire for so long, you learn to predict where a mortar shell will fall by the sound it makes. I'd never have thought about it, but one fateful day changed everything.
Did you hear that? Another mortar shell. Not very far from here. Many people got used to the sound but I cringe at every single one of them. I freeze and remember one summer day in the first year of the war. The day which changed everything in my life.
The heat was intense and people were lining up for water. I was there with my parents and Tadei. Suddenly, there was a flash and I lost consciousness. Later I learned that a mortar shell exploded among us, wounding me and my brother and killing my parents. I had to explain to my brother that they were gone. Can you imagine losing your parents at the age of six?
The heat was intense and people were lining up for water. I was there with my parents and Tadei when a shell exploded among us. When I got up and looked around, there were screams... blood... dead bodies everywhere... severed limbs... My brother was bleeding, crying, asking me where mommy and daddy were. I looked around, then hugged him and started to scream.
Doctors did a great job patching us up. We spent a few weeks in the hospital recovering, both physically and mentally. We were lucky that we survived, and we had each other. Our neighbors were helping me look after Tadei, because initially I had trouble catching up with him! Then he got his lucky ticket.
I don't recall how we got to the hospital. They took out lots of shrapnel from our bodies. I became apathetic in the aftermath. Our neighbors started looking after my brother, because I'd lost the will to live. I kept thinking that I had cheated fate on that day. I no longer hid when I heard a shell. And then Tadei was taken from me.
The massacre was all over the TV news. In the aftermath, we were approached by a charity which offered foster homes for children in Canada. I decided to let them take Tadei out of Pogoren. He is now safe. I'm temporarily stuck here, but one day I'll join him and we'll be together again. I have a very good reason to stay alive.
The massacre was all over the TV news. The footage showed us, bleeding, crying over the bodies of our parents. A charity got my brother out of Pogoren to Canada, to a foster home. But they left me here. I decided to live in spite of everything. One day I'll go to Canada, too. I don't want to die here, all alone and forgotten.
Zlata survived the war and was reunited with her brother in Canada. It took her some time to adjust to the new reality, but she found a job, and even resumed her music studies - at the Royal Conservatory in Toronto.
Zlata survived the war, but reaching Canada proved more difficult than she'd anticipated. Despite the difficulties, she remains determined and still believes she will see Tadei again one day.
The war changed Zlata. She survived, but lost her optimism and cheerfulness. She decided against joining her brother. "I would only remind him of past horrors", she explained. "No, it will be better if I stay in Pogoren. Someone needs to tend to our parents' grave."
Zlata did not survive even though she was so young and full of life. Would she resume her music studies had she survived? Maybe the world lost a famous musician or composer.
Zlata was not allowed to stay in the shelter. Let's hope she had better luck elsewhere.
Zlata left the shelter one night. She fell victim to human traffickers while trying to reach her brother in Canada.
Zlata was a sensitive and compassionate girl, who tried to give hope to others. In the end, she herself lost all hope and took her own life. The world got bleaker the day she was found dead.
I was just accepted to the music academy when the war broke out. I had so many plans, I had dreams. I used to play the guitar, date boys, dance. My little brother Tadei always made me smile. It all seems a dream now, replaced by this nightmare we live in. Yet, I still hope one day we can forget the war and carry on with our lives as if it had never happened.
Hi, you look friendly. My name's Zlata. I used to study at the Music Academy before it got closed due to war. What about we stick together for the time being? We can watch over each other! Besides, it's always better to have some company to cheer you up!
I’ll miss Zlata’s smile. Not many people smile these days. It’s really painful to see such a young life wasted.
I've been around more than any of my friends and relatives. I've met famous people, readers found my interviews funny and incisive. But when I try to write down my experiences... I'm stuck. I want to find and hug my folks, not write about them. I wish I had been seeing them more often.
I've been around more than any of my friends and relatives, been to the Oscar galas, talked to socialites. I should've stayed with my own people and talked to my folks. Instead, I wasted my life writing fluff pieces on buffoons - and deemed it important! You don't appreciate what you have until you lose it.
This city used to welcome everybody with open arms. I loved the old town cafes where I could meet new friends from all over the world. Will people ever become this easygoing again? If we make it through, I must do what I can to help them remember how it was. Because we can accomplish a lot if we just stand together.
So many years I've spent away that I hardly recognized my city. I used to be friends with everybody. Now, if I smile to a stranger I'm taken for a fool or a prostitute or, worse still, a snitch. But I'm fine with that, there are other ways to compel people into seeing things my way.
When, defeated, I was about to leave my parents' neighborhood, my childhood friend recognized me. I thought he'd help me find out what happened to my folks. Turned out it was I who could help. A local girl had been held up by the army under some pretense. Everybody turned up at the base to protest and demand her release. They needed a deputy.
I was about to leave my parents' neighborhood empty-handed when an acquaintance halted me and said that there was a "situation" I could help with. The army had arrested a local beauty under some cooked up charges. I guess it doesn't need explaining what she was wanted for. The locals pooled the ransom money and needed someone to deliver it.
I marched into the base flashing my press badge and demanded - in English! - to see the commander. After a bit of bickering, he assured me that there must have been some mix-up and that the girl would be released. I guess the envelope with "evidence" gathered among the locals helped as much as my bluff... but what counts is that we got her out.
My press badge and a bit of bluffing bought me five minutes with the commander. It was all I needed to convince him that it would be in his best interests to give up the girl and take the bribe. He insisted that we exchange contacts to meet "in more opportune circumstances". I agreed... I still could use the opportunity to erase that smug smile off his face forever.
Katia used her contacts to find her parents in a refugee camp abroad. She brought them back to the city and helped rebuild their house. Soon after that she published her war diary, which became a bestseller and drew widespread attention to the fate of civilians during war.
Katia used her contacts to find her parents in a refugee camp abroad. She returned to her city, but they refused and once again they were separated. After a few years they passed away and only then did Katia find the determination to publish her war diary.
After the war Katia located her parents in a refugee camp abroad, but they were no longer the people she knew. They remained abroad, where they're struggling to forget the past. Katia has burnt all her notes and she never writes about the war.
Katia never found her parents, but they did find her grave one day with her war diary buried alongside. They published it without any alterations. It became a bestseller.
Katia's smooth talking didn't secure her a place in the shelter. Unfortunately, she was later captured by the military and spent the rest of the war imprisoned. She never spoke of what happened to her in captivity.
Katia left the shelter one night, leaving behind her war diary. It was passed to her distraught parents, who published it after a few years.
Unable to cope with what had transpired, Katia broke down completely. She was found dead, her hand still clutching her war diary. Her parents never learnt about her fate.
I grew up in this city, but went abroad to study and started working as a reporter. I'd been away for years. When the troubles escalated into a war, I was picked to write reports on it. I'd have volunteered anyway, I was so anxious to check on my parents. But it was too late. I found my house in ruins, my family had disappeared. I've been looking for them ever since.
Hi, I'm Katia. Before this hell broke out I used to work as a reporter. I was the first to deliver breaking news, meet important people, and I travelled a lot. Now I don't even know where my family is. I hope they went into hiding and are ok. I'll stay here with you until the fighting is over, ok?
Katia will not find her parents after all. She still had her diary, her parents should get it when this is over.

^CharacterName^ managed to survive the war. Despite being a psychologist, {ms|he}{fs|she} could not cope with the horrors {ms|he}{fs|she} had witnessed and experienced during the siege of Pogoren. Several months after the war {ms|he}{fs|she} thrown {ms|himself}{fs|herself} under a train.
Like many other civilians in besieged Pogoren, ^CharacterName^ didn’t make it. {ms|His}{fs|Her} decision to stay and help others cost {ms|him}{fs|her} {ms|his}{fs|her} life. Was {ms|his}{fs|her} sacrifice in vain?
One night ^CharacterName^ left the shelter without saying anything to anyone. When morning came, {ms|he}{fs|she} had already been gone. Whatever {ms|his}{fs|her} reasons were, they would remain unknown.
{ms|He}{fs|She} whose job was to help people cope with their problems and find the strength to live on, could not cope with {ms|his}{fs|her} own and committed suicide. What’s wrong with this world?
As a psychologist, my work is to solve other people’s problems. I’d met with so many different cases I thought I’ve seen it all. How wrong I was. I’m so grateful I’ve got no family in Pogoren, I don’t know what I’d do if I had. I thought about leaving, but decided against it. “Hell, this is my city, these are my people” – I thought. Now… I’m not so sure it was the right decision. But since I can’t change it, let’s try to make the best out of our situation, regardless of how dire it is.
^CharacterName^ was a kind person, who always listened to everyone and had some advice for them. Pity.
After the war ^CharacterName^ managed to find the model for whom {ms|he}{fs|she} came to Pogoren. They realized they had more in common than they had initially thought. Together they left Graznavia to seek a better future.
When the war ended ^CharacterName^ went back home. {ms|He}{fs|She} hasn’t heard any news about the fate of the fascinating, young model {ms|he}{fs|she} had met in Pogoren, even though {ms|he}{fs|she} tried to contact her. Was she alive? Did she manage to avoid the atrocities? Would she even remember {ms|him}{fs|her}? ^CharacterName^ still has no answers.
When the end of war made travel once more possible ^CharacterName^ went back home. {ms|He}{fs|She} tried to find something about the young model {ms|he}{fs|she} had met in Pogoren but failed. Most likely she did not survive. A handful of pictures and memories was all that was left of her.
War took ^CharacterName^’s life. {ms|He}{fs|She} was in the wrong place at the wrong time. It’s terrifying how blind chance can determine whether we live or die.
One night ^CharacterName^ slipped away from the shelter. All trace of {ms|him}{fs|her} was lost.
Despite support from others, ^CharacterName^ gave up on hope and committed suicide. Who would’ve known it would end like this, when {ms|he}{fs|she} arrived in Pogoren?
I came to Pogoren on business. I met a young, lovely model. I agreed for a photo session with her, as I thought she was exceptional and expected she would make a great career. We met a couple of times, before and after the photo shoot. Unfortunately war put an end to all of that. I don’t know what happened to that girl, but I got stuck here with no way to get back home. I’m afraid I might not make it out of here alive.
Poor ^CharacterName^, did you have to die?
^CharacterName^ survived the war and managed to find {ms|his}{fs|her} {ms|girlfriend}{fs|boyfriend}. It turned out {ms|Kate}{fs|John} had sent many letters, but they failed to reach ^CharacterName^ in Pogoren due to the siege. It took them some time to adjust to being together again, but they finally resumed their wedding plans.
As soon as it became possible ^CharacterName^ went to the UK to visit {ms|his}{fs|her} beloved. They tried being together again, but it did not work out. ^CharacterName^’s war experiences and long separation changed them too much, so they decided to go their separate ways. Eventually, each found someone to live the rest of their life with. They remain pen friends, if nothing more.
To {ms|his}{fs|her} disappointment ^CharacterName^’s fears came true. Years of separation put their feelings to the test, and {ms|Kate}{fs|John} eventually gave up on {ms|him}{fs|her}. The hope of seeing {ms|Kate}{fs|John} again was what kept ^CharacterName^ alive through the war. Now {ms|his}{fs|her} life became empty and pointless. {ms|His}{fs|Her} depression discouraged others from attaching themselves to {ms|him}{fs|her}, and {ms|he}{fs|she} remained lonely for the rest of {ms|his}{fs|her} life.
It wasn’t until a year after the war that {ms|Kate}{fs|John} learned of ^CharacterName^’s tragic death, but at that time {ms|she}{fs|he} had already been married to someone else anyway.
One night ^CharacterName^ left the shelter to attempt to escape from Pogoren. {ms|He}{fs|She} was shot dead by a military sentry.
Overcome by despair, having lost all hope to see {ms|Kate}{fs|John} ever again, ^CharacterName^ chose to end {ms|his}{fs|her} life.
This fucking siege couldn’t have come at a worse moment. I have a {ms|girlfriend, Kate}{fs|boyfriend, John}. We first met during a student exchange in the UK. {ms|She}{fs|He} came to Pogoren for holiday and then moved here to stay. We’d just finished paying off our flat, and were about to get married, when we got the news of the siege. {ms|She}{fs|He} managed to board one of the last planes that left before the airport got closed. I didn’t. It’s been about three years since I last saw {ms|her}{fs|him} No letter came. I’m worried...
You didn’t make it after all, ^CharacterName^. If I survive, I will tell your story to your beloved.
^CharacterName^ and {ms|his}{fs|her} parents survived the war. They retired to the country, while {ms|he}{fs|she} resumed work at the pharmacy, and is doing really fine. As Pogoren slowly healed from the destruction, so did most of its inhabitants.
Although ^CharacterName^ and {ms|his}{fs|her} family managed to survive the war, not all was well. Living in the basement made ^CharacterName^’s parents contract a serious lung disease. Most of their retirement money went to buying necessary medicines, and ^CharacterName^ had to take the burden of supporting them.
When ^CharacterName^ got back to {ms|his}{fs|her} parents, it turned out they were both dying of disease. Several months after the war, ^CharacterName^ buried them at Pogoren cemetery. With a heavy heart {ms|he}{fs|she} resumed work at the pharmacy, but all the joy of success was gone, replaced with deep, lingering sadness.
^CharacterName^ died before the war ended. {ms|His}{fs|Her} parents joined {ms|him}{fs|her} shortly after, killed by a lung disease they had contracted while living in the basement.
^CharacterName^ left the shelter for reasons known only to {ms|him}{fs|her}. Who knows what happened to {ms|him}{fs|her}.
^CharacterName^ committed suicide. {ms|His}{fs|Her} old parents died from disease soon after, not knowing their child’s fate.
Before all this mess, it had been a really good year for me. I was appreciated at work and finally got promoted. Even though everyone around was worried about the threat of war, I found the notion that it might reach us here very improbable. One day, shortly after I came home to tell my parents about my promotion, we heard alarm sirens. We managed to hide in our basement just before the first explosions shook the ground and everything got covered by dust.
Farewell ^CharacterName^, you’ll be missed.
As soon as the fighting stopped, ^CharacterName^ left Pogoren to seek better life elsewhere. Thanks to a foreign charity that organized an aid program for Graznavia war refugees {ms|he}{fs|she} ended up in the woodlands of Canada, happy to remain close to nature and far from people’s affairs.
Even though the fighting ended, ^CharacterName^ had trouble finding {ms|his}{fs|her} place in the world. For some time {ms|he}{fs|she} had been receiving help from various charities, but when that ran out, {ms|he}{fs|she} remained in Pogoren; a homeless and unemployed scavenger.
When the war ended, ^CharacterName^ had problems adapting. Like many people in similar circumstances {ms|he}{fs|she} found solace in drinking. Homeless, unemployed, rejected by society, {ms|he}{fs|she} went on a downward spiral, until one winter day {ms|his}{fs|her} body was found frozen in the street.
^CharacterName^ joined the long list of civilian casualties of war. With no family to miss {ms|him}{fs|her}, {ms|he}{fs|she} would soon be forgotten.
Looking for more luck elsewhere, ^CharacterName^ left the shelter and {ms|his}{fs|her} further wherebouts remain unknown.
Having lost all hope ^CharacterName^ commited suicide. With no family to miss {ms|him}{fs|her}, {ms|he}{fs|she} would soon be forgotten.
When the war broke out, I’d been unemployed for over a year. With dread I watched the news of the upcoming conflict. I was hoping against hope it would not come. Living of unemployment benefits had already been hard, and with the soaring prices I wouldn’t have made it, if not for the people running the shelter for the homeless. They were very kind and welcoming, and I could always count on a bowl of hot soup. But that’s the past. A shell hit their shelter.
^CharacterName^’s body… Poor soul; I wonder if {ms|he}{fs|she} has some supplies on {ms|him}{fs|her}…
When the siege was lifted, ^CharacterName^ quickly returned home. Though shaken, underfed and exhausted {ms|he}{fs|she} knew that this affair could’ve ended up much worse than that. {ms|He}{fs|She} would never come back to Pogoren again.
When the siege was lifted, ^CharacterName^ quickly took the opportunity to return home. The memories of what had transpired in Pogoren would change {ms|him}{fs|her} forever.
^CharacterName^ returned home as soon as the siege of Pogoren was lifted. The horrors {ms|he}{fs|she} witnessed and was part of would scar {ms|him}{fs|her} forever. {ms|He}{fs|She} would never feel safe again, and would always keep an ample stash of food and most important supplies, just in case.
^CharacterName^ shared the fate of many other unfortunate souls who were caught in the siege of Pogoren.
^CharacterName^ left the shelter, deciding {ms|he}{fs|she} would fare better on {ms|his}{fs|her} own.
^CharacterName^ was pushed to {ms|his}{fs|her} limits, broke under pressure and commited suicide.
I was on holiday when the siege began. I had met an interesting {ms|woman}{fs|man} on the Internet and after several months of chatting I decided to accept {ms|her}{fs|his} invitation to visit {ms|her}{fs|him}. {ms|She}{fs|He} showed me around Pogoren. I was anxious why so many people were leaving. There was an ominous aura over the city. However, I was assured that there was nothing to worry about. Nobody here wanted war and they would never allow it to break out. But it did. I tried to flee the city but it was already too late.
Maybe you weren’t the best friend I’ve ever had, ^CharacterName^, but we were in this mess together. And now you’re dead.
When the fighting stopped, ^CharacterName^ went home, heart pounding with fear of what {ms|He}{fs|She} might await {ms|him}{fs|her} there. Miraculously, the house was still standing and {ms|his}{fs|her} mother was alright.
When the fighting stopped, ^CharacterName^ went home, with dark thoughts going through {ms|his}{fs|her} head. The area was heavily ravaged by artillery fire, and {ms|his}{fs|her} house was destroyed. {ms|His}{fs|Her} mother was alive though, saved by neighbors.
When the fighting stopped, ^CharacterName^ went home, only to find it in ruins. {ms|His}{fs|Her} mother was nowhere around. The neighbors said there was still hope, that she could’ve moved to one of the refugee camps. But ^CharacterName^ knew better.
^CharacterName^ died during the siege of Pogoren. The fate of {ms|his}{fs|her} mother remains unknown.
^CharacterName^ left the shelter at night, in search of {ms|his}{fs|her} mother. Did {ms|he}{fs|she} manage to get through the front line to the cut-off area? Hopefully, yes.
Rather than continue suffering, ^CharacterName^ decided to take {ms|his}{fs|her} own life. Her mother was heartbroken.
The hospital where I worked was not evacuated. No one knew what was about to happen, until it was too late. The news of the siege were so sudden, and the patients so numerous that nothing could have been done in time. We had a huge influx of wounded. After the horrors of the first day I decided to leave the hospital to stay with my mother, but that part of town had already been cut off. I hope my mother is alright.
Damn it, ^CharacterName^, how did you get yourself killed…
^CharacterName^ survived the war, and found {ms|his}{fs|her} beloved in one of the temporary refugee camps. They managed to put their war experiences behind them, and remain a couple until this day.
^CharacterName^ survived, and after a long search managed to find {ms|his}{fs|her} beloved, who was scarred by he fire and became gloomy and withdrawn. {ms|He}{fs|She} stayed with {ms|her}{fs|him} although things were never the same again.
The things ^CharacterName^ witnessed and did during the war, made {mr|him}{fr|her} lose conviction. {mr|He}{fr|She} did not return to work as a police officer, nor did {mr|he}{fr|she} think {mr|himself}{fr|herself} worthy of {mr|his}{fr|her} beloved. They never saw each other again.
Sadly ^CharacterName^ did not live to see the end of the fighting. Collateral damage, as the military would put it.
One night ^CharacterName^ left the shelter and did not come back. {ms|His}{fs|Her} motivation remains unknown.
^CharacterName^ could not take it anymore and chose to take {ms|his}{fs|her} life, rather than continue like this.
Just before war reached Pogoren, our unit had received news of planned evacuation of most of the uniformed services from the city. I stayed, because I failed to convince my beloved to leave, and I couldn’t leave {ms|her}{fs|him} here alone. We didn’t know how dire the situation would become. One day, when I was coming home from a walk with my dog, I heard the first alarm sirens. I ran as fast as I could, but it was already too late. My flat was in flames. I couldn’t find my beloved… or {ms|her}{fs|his} body…
As a police officer, you probably always took risks, but I bet you never expected to die like this.
Hello neighbor! Are you doing alright?
I'll better be going now. Keep warm!
Well, have it your way. Goodbye.
Hi! I have some good news!
Glad I could help! Keep safe!
I'll share with someone else then. Keep safe.

Thank you for opening the door!
Quickly, come with me!
I'll try to ask someone else then. I gotta hurry!
Hello again.
Thank you so much, you're saving that man's life!
What can I do? Without bandages he won't make it.
Hello, I've come to thank you.
Thanks again, I won't forget you!
You're so kind! I'll never forget what you did for my dad!
Nice to meet you, neighbor!
We'll come over to visit sometime!
Well, more vegetables for us then. See you around!
Good to see you again!
Thank you, we really appreciate your help!
We understand you have other things to do.
We're so glad to see you!
Enjoy! Think of us sometimes!
We'll drink to your health then! Bye!
Hello...
Thank you. He deserves a proper funeral.
I'll try to do it myself then... He deserves a proper funeral.
Hi there! You're new here, aren't you?
Let's go then!
Your choice, but you're wasting a great opportunity!
Hello! I've got a proposition for you!
Come on, I don't bite!
No reason to be afraid!
Got some news for you!
Listen to what I have to say.
Listen to me.
So, shall we talk or what?
Got a proposition for you.
Are you sure?
Think this through.
I won't come again if you say no.
It's me again! Gotta minute?
Let's teach them a lesson!
I'll teach them a lesson myself, then!
It's me again! Let's talk!
Why do you keep me waiting?
I know you're there!
Hurry up and open the door!
Let's talk.
Come on!
Hot news!
I got tipped off.
Oh, come on!
You can profit!
You're wasting an opportunity!
Hello again, partner!
Great! Let's do it!
Suit yourself, but don't come crying when you're out of meds!
Hey partners, another job!
You'll like what I have to say!
Open up, you'll be really interested!
Don't keep me waiting!
Good to see you again!
Hey partners, let's talk.
I have a plan.
Let's work together again!
Think about all those medical supplies!
It's an easy job!
Let's go! Come on!
Hello! Oh... Anna isn't here, is she?
Thanks a lot! If she comes, please tell her I've been looking for her!
At least tell her I've been looking for her if she comes, ok?
Hi there, neighbors!
Great, you won't regret it!
I'll go on my own then, it's a great opportunity to replenish supplies.
You've done your duty to the Vyseni people!
We'll keep looking for the culprit. Let us know if you learn something.
Open up! We're Vyseni militia!
Open up!
We know you're there!
You'd better open the door!
We have some questions!
Don't keep us waiting!
We want to talk!
We need your assistance!
Are you sure it wasn't him?
Remember, there's a reward.
We can refresh your memory!
Good morning, It's me again.
Once again, thank you!
I will tell the others you are good and loyal neighbors!
Our mom is sick, please help us!
Thank you! Quickly, let's get the medicine to mom!
No one else has any medication around here... You were our last hope...
Hello again... We're hungry...
Yay! Thanks! Real food!
Let's go look in the rubbish bins downtown.
Please, you gotta help us!
Let's hurry up!
What are we going to do now? We can't let mommy die!
Hi! I want to thank you!
I hope you like it! Thank you for helping us!
Thanks again! I hope my husband comes home soon...
Thank goodness you're here!
I don't know how to thank you enough! God bless you!
We'll just have to hope for the best then...
It's me again, sorry to disturb you but I'm terrified!
Thank you! I knew I could count on you!
I see... maybe they won't hurt us... but we must prepare for the worst...
Hi again! I came to thank you for your help.
I hope you don't need to use it, but you never know.
We'll keep it then. I hope you really won't need it.
I need bandages and medicine for my father.
My father's unwell, do you have medication or bandages?
I'll give you a lot for medical supplies.
I prefer to trade this for medicine, bandages, or alcohol.
What can I give you for this?
Dad, no!
Father! No... No!
Dad! Dad! Oh no...
Dad... I miss you...
What am I gonna tell mom?
I thought I could protect you... It's all my fault...
Dad... If only I could find those bastards...
Hey, you! I need meds for my father, got some?
Thank you! This helps us a lot!
Please, bring some bandages or medication...
Someone's here!
Son! Help me!
Someone's here again!
Son! Son! It's this intruder again!
Son, no...
Son... my son... don't leave me...
Please... What am I going to do without you?
No... I should've been the first to go... Why...
{mr|Sir}{fr|Madam}, I'm so hungry...
Please {mr|sir}{fr|madam}, could you spare something to eat?
I haven't eaten for days... Could you help me?
I'm too weak to search for food. I'd be grateful for any help.
Perhaps you could bring some food next time...?
It's humiliating, but I'm forced to beg you for help...
I'll die in a few days without food...
You didn't seem to be such a heartless {mr|man}{fr|woman}...
There were more of us living here before the food ran out...
I moved after I'd lost my house in a shelling...
One of us was torn apart by a shell. He was standing too close to the wall.
Does it matter if someone became homeless before or during the war?
Much obliged, kind {mr|sir}{fr|lady}...
I'm so grateful...
Thank you once again...
I don't know how to thank you enough...
I'm very hungry. Could you help me...?
Good evening, {mr|sir}{fr|madam}!
Oh... Hello again, {mr|sir}{fr|madam}.
Did {mr|he}{fr|she} leave...?
I won't bother you anymore...
Well... Maybe next time.
I have something you may find interesting...
I will show you, come with me.
Have a look, there's something peculiar behind the barrels.
I don't feel well...
Hey, you scared me!
I found him like this.
No one fucks with us! We own this city!
I'm a little drunk!
I need some sleep...
The building across the street looks quite wealthy.
We should raid it tomorrow night.
...I have to take care of my parents......
...because if not me, then who?
MOM! Everything alright?
Oh, she doesn't hear me, she's a little deaf...
Hi, you need something?
Thanks!
Maybe next time.
Oh yeah, she knows how to handle a man.
Oh my God, is it really finally over?
I can't believe it, are we really saved?
Can it be true? Is it the end of this nightmare?
How many supplies are left...?
Do we have enough supplies?
I should check what they brought...
What have we got here...?
Let's see...
Some bandages, ammo...
Weapons...
...some useless shit...
... and... what's this thing...?
...cans from humanitarian aid... they make me puke...
That's a nice stock.
Enough for a few days.
Could be better.
We need weapons, you got some?
If you want anything else, be quick about it, we might be leaving soon.
You haven't got anything? Damn...
If you want to trade, meet me in the courtyard.
Stop right there, I'll come down to you.
Leave the building! We'll trade outside.
Show yourself!
Don't hide!
You're dead!
Watch it, this is a restricted area. Better have some good stuff to trade.
You did your civic duty, heh heh...
Next time bring more booze, citizen.
Come with me!
Excuse me.
Better move.
Move!
Enough, they can't find us.
Dead.
Bullseye.
Hit.
Wounded.
I missed.
Target still alive.
Whoa!
My ears!
So loud!
Wait!
Coming.
After You.
Guy near the water collector.
The kid leaning through the window.
Rebel militiaman at checkpoint.
Woman gathering wood.
Man sneaking through those ruins.
Woman with shopping bags.
Soldiers! Run!
Hey, stranger! Wanna trade? Go to the first floor.
Please, don't hurt me! They captured me! I'm a hostage.
Get away from here! If you want to trade, go downstairs.
Where is my husband...?
What is going on...?
Please, call my husband.
I don't understand, where did my husband go?
Is something wrong, my dear?
What happened?
What is happening...? Who are you?
Oh... How did you enter...?
What are you looking for?
My wife's sick and not in the mood for visitors.
I heard it's dangerous... We try not to go out.
I'm afraid we can't do anything for you...
Are you looking for valuables? I'm afraid we sold everything.
Please, at least don't hurt my wife, she's not well...
Are you gonna kill us...?
You are with the bandits? I heard they rob people blind...
What are you doing? Please, leave something for us...
Why are you taking this? It's ours!
I beg you, don't take the food, we have so little.
Please, don't take my wife's medicine...
Do you have to do that? Where's your conscience!
It's you again? What do you want from us?
I was hoping you wouldn't come back...
What a strange visitor...
I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} won't come back...
Please don’t take our things!
How can you do this?
Have mercy! Don’t take that!
Move, bitch. Wanna piss off the army?
Shut up! You should be proud to serve a soldier.
Walk, you piece of shit, don't make me smack you.
Sure you will... Now get in there and shut up!
Please, let me go...
Just let me go... I won't tell anyone...
No! Please! I can't do this!
I beg you... I'll do anything...
Please, help me!
You heard about what that soldier did? Unthinkable...
She used to live next door... helped me with the groceries sometimes.
No one helped... It was one drunk soldier... Someone could have stopped him.
It's the worst thing this war does to us... People just don't care anymore.
You heard about that soldier, what he tried to do? Good thing the girl is safe now...
She lives next door, helps me with the groceries sometimes.
I don't want to think what would've happened if this soldier hadn't been stopped.
She's exhausted and shocked, but her family is taking care of her.
The military can't do what they want with impunity!
People still have the strength to fight back!
Luba, you take the downstairs.
Igor, you take the upstairs and the roof.
Got it!
Help! Please, help me!
A sniper shot me... you're lucky he didn't kill you.
I was going home with medicine for my boy when I was hit...
I wanted to use the sewers, but someone blocked the entrance...
Please, can you do something about it?
Please, I need to get to my boy, he's just a baby...
That bastard is still shooting... Why won't he leave us alone?
Could you please do something about the sewer door?
If I try to run for it, I'm dead...
You don't know how grateful I am... Come with me, I'll try to repay you somehow.
Did I just hear {mr|him}{fr|her} open that door...?
I think I will have something for you.
Follow me, I have a flat nearby.
We're almost there. I just hope my boy is fine...
He needs me... I've gotta hold on...
Damn, it hurts so much... But there's no time for self-pity.
Just a few more steps and everything will be fine...
Jakob, daddy's here... And he's not going anywhere...
There's a box beneath the bed, take as much as you need.
I don't want to think what would have happened if it wasn't for you.
Good, the fever is dropping...
I brought everything we need, Jakob. We're gonna make it.
Your dad had some adventures, little guy.
I know you don't like the taste, but you have to eat it...
I tell you, if I could get my hands on that sniper...
I don't wanna think how many lives his bullets took...
Better think twice before going there.
As for me, I'm gonna stick to this building.
I must admit this sniper is one dangerous warrior. Elusive like a ghost.
Watch out, you don't wanna get shot by the sniper.
The bastard is in the hotel, covers the whole damn street.
You either take cover behind something or stay away.
I know exactly when this war will end. I know.
I'm not gonna tell, oh no. They're listening. Shhh!
This war is a part of a greater plan... but don't tell anyone.
I know what they want! But if I tell you, we're both dead!
I know how to end this hell... but it's a secret.
Fools! I told them this was folly, but they wouldn't listen!
It began here, yet it will end with the whole world in ashes!
I tell you, it's all a chess game for politicians. Let's not be their pawns!
And when the darkness rises in the East, I shall take up my sword!
Oh, hello! Don't be afraid, I'm just looking around.
This area is off limits. Leave now.
Help!
Oh, no!
Don't hurt me...
Please, no!
Hello. Is everything alright?
Please, behave! You're in a hospital!
If you have medications to trade, you should talk to the doctor.
We've lost so many patients...
The last shelling was the worst. It's a miracle we can still work.
Some of the personnel died, but some just left. I don't blame them.
We're trying to admit everyone. Even if they wear a uniform.
I should check the medication stock.
I need some bandages.
We're running low...
Only a few left.
My goodness, what happened to you? Let me help you.
You don't look well, {mr|sir}{fr|ma'am}. Can I help you?
If you need my help, I'll do what I can.
Here, you should feel better soon.
I hope this helps.
I'm sorry I can't do more, but we have very limited resources.
I'm sorry but we have patients in more serious condition.
You don't seem to need my help.
If you get worse, I'll be here to help you.
Hello... After the last shelling, we can't admit any more patients.
Please, speak with the doctor! We desperately need medicines and bandages.
Please, don't disturb the patients. They're still in shock!
The shelling... I don't wanna remember...
So many patients died in the shelling... So many...
We're gonna save as many as we can.
We can't give up... We're responsible for them...
Are there any bandages left...?
Oh yes... the medication...
Not enough... not enough...
How are we gonna work with no supplies?
Excuse me... We're in a dire situation...
You're here to see the doctor? I'm afraid he's... he's dead.
Be careful, there's been a murder recently...
How can people be so cruel?
It's so hard without the doctor...
Doctor Jefimow was a hero.
Are there any bandages left...?
I doubt there are any medications left...
Now there's no one to restock the supplies.
The doctor managed to get the medicine somehow.
Evening. If you have any medicine or bandages, I'll buy them from you.
Evening. Are you here to donate medical supplies?
The hospital is grateful for your contribution.
The patients will appreciate this.
If you aren't interested in helping us, why are you bothering me?
If you don't want to help, at least don't disturb.
Hurry up, I'm busy.
Why are you hesitating?
Are you here to donate supplies? If not, leave me alone.
After the last shelling we need some damn charity... Excuse my French.
Good... Have you got more?
Yeah, thank you. Maybe we'll have fewer deaths tonight.
Why are you wasting my time? Can't you see what's going on here?!
What? Nothing? Why the hell are you even here?!
Hurry up, people are dying here.
Still making up your mind? Maybe you could do it elsewhere.
Are you from the group that helped us lately?
We had a generous offer lately. Will you top that?
Good. Almost as good as the last time.
The hospital is grateful, but I personally expected more.
I thought better of you. What a disappointment.
I guess I thought too highly of you.
We still need more supplies.
The hospital had some help, but there's never enough.
We need supplies more than ever. Some bastard has robbed us lately.
Hello. Any donation is welcome after the last robbery.
Thank you. I'll make sure the guards don't allow anyone to take it.
We still have a shortage after the theft, but it's better than nothing.
You interrupted my work for this? Who do you think you are?
I can handle thieves, but I don't have the patience for idiots.
Listen, I have security issues on my head right now.
Are you here to trade, or to prowl...?
Are you a patient?
It's like a field hospital built on the ruins of a real one...
I'm lucky they admitted me.
Nurses here are like angels!
Someone should give those nurses a medal.
I don't think doctor Jefimow gets his salary.
No more shellings... Please...
Prayer doesn't help...
Doctor Jefimow seems shattered...
I fear these are the last days of this hospital...
Sometimes I regret I survived the shelling...
We lost Julian. Doesn't matter that he was a soldier, he was one of us.
A nurse died... She was like family to me.
Have you heard? They killed our doctor.
It was hard before, but now...
Doctor Jefimow saved so many lives. Why would anyone want to take his?
Some people are worse than beasts, I tell you.
Good we still have the nurses.
Hey you! Can you help?
If you find any medical supplies in the rubble, return them to the doctor.
We lost much in the last shelling, we could use an extra pair of hands.
Always so bullheaded... I told you this would happen!
Oh... hello. Don't mind me, I was taking care of an old friend of mine.
He didn't deserve to become crow food. Nobody does. Take care of youself.
Take care of yourself.
{mr|Son of a bitch!}{fr|You cunt!}
What?!
Shit!
What...?!
Hey! What are you looking for?!
Who are you?!
{mr|He}{fr|She}'s still here!
{mr|He}{fr|She}'s here again!
It's you again?!
What?!
Someone's here!
Who's there? Oh, I thought you might be one of those crazy girls...
Oh, look out for these crazy bitches in the second building.
Hi. Don't make any trouble.
Careful {mr|pal}{fr|girl}, I've got my eye on you.
Hey {mr|man}{fr|lady}. Don't do anything stupid, okay?
Oh! I didn't know someone's here.
Hey! Don't sneak up on me like that, {mr|pal}{fr|girl}...
Oh... Hello...
Someone's here? Good evening.
You don't wanna cause trouble here, trust me.
Don't mess with me...
I've got my eye on you.
I don't want any trouble.
Don't mind me.
I don't mean any harm.
I'm just looking for something...
Let's not get in each other's way.
I'll kill you!
You're dead!
That was your last mistake!
Die, {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}!
Get the {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}!
Hit {mr|him}{fr|her}!
Don't go easy on {mr|him}{fr|her}!
Make {mr|him}{fr|her} leave!
Get {mr|him}{fr|her}!
Do something!
Stop! Leave {mr|him}{fr|her} alone!
You'll regret touching {mr|him}{fr|her}!
You made a big mistake hurting {mr|him}{fr|her}!
Please, don't hurt {mr|him}{fr|her}!
No! Leave {mr|him}{fr|her} alone!
Stop it! Why are you hurting {mr|him}{fr|her}?!
That's it, I'm going back...
I better go back.
Come out, you {mr|bastard}{fr|cunt}!
Where is this {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}...
I'm gonna find you!
Where is {mr|he}{fr|she}?
Is {mr|he}{fr|she}'s hiding?
Is {mr|he}{fr|she} still here...?
Where's that fuckin' murderer...
^CharacterName^... I will find the fucker who did this to you.
You'll pay for what you did to ^CharacterName^!
Where are you, bastard? I'll get you!
Whoever you are, you'll pay for this!
You killed ^CharacterName^! You won't get away from me!
I'll get you for what you did to ^CharacterName^!
You can run but you can't hide!
Found that {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}!
The {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch} is here!
Found you!
No, {mr|he}{fr|she}'s still here!
I found {mr|him}{fr|her}!
{mr|He}{fr|She}'s here!
Someone's here, ^CharacterName^?
What's going on, ^CharacterName^? Who are you looking for?
I'll help you find {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Let's look for {mr|him}{fr|her} together.
I think {mr|he}{fr|she} got away.
{mr|He}{fr|She} must've fled.
I'm out!
Screw this...
Fuck it...
Help!
Oh, no!
Bandits!
Please, no!
Don't hurt me...
Just take what you want...
Why are you doing this...?
Don't hurt me...
Please... No...
I beg you... stop...
I'm hungry. Maybe there's something left in the fridge.
Let's check if there's any food left.
I should eat something.
Enough for now.
It's much better.
Someone turned on the radio...?
Huh? What's making this noise?
The radio's on?
It's better when it's quiet.
Shut up, you piece of junk.
Weird, did it turn on by itself?
That old picture... I think it needs dusting.
These old pictures got all dusty...
Ah, I miss the good old times...
Those days are over...
I wonder if there are any meds left in the bath cabinet.
I should take some pills from the bath cabinet.
We're running short on meds...
Just one pill and I'm going back...
There's gotta be something useful here...
Maybe there's still something left?
It bothers me that I've lost it, I've gotta find it...
Where did I put that...?
Maybe some food...
Some meds...?
What have we got here...
Is it here...?
This is trash...
I won't need that!
Interesting...
It must be somewhere!
Oh, this could come in handy...
What's this? I'll take it...
I'm almost sure I saw it...
Eh, all good stuff already taken, as usual.
Could be better.
Well, it's better than nothing.
I will find it, eventually...
It's probably somewhere else.
Maybe there's still some firewood left in that pile...
Maybe I can still find something useful here...
Let's see...
Maybe this...?
This neither...
Nothing.
Just some trash.
Do you have springs? My boiler is broken.
I'm looking for copper pipes.
You still have that cherry moonshine?
Can I clean wounds with this?
I need some bandages.
Do you have insulin?
This rat looks rotten.
These tomatoes are so small...
Hmm... maybe this?
Do I really need this?
It looks useless.
Do I have everything?
I think I forgot something...
One more thing and I'll go back.
When will we have the running water back...?
I wonder if the water is running again...
Still no water.
One day they'll turn the water on.
I need to get some fresh air.
I'll get some air...
A bit windy tonight...
It's calm...
It's so cold here, I should go back.
No time for this, I should be back.
I'd better check the armory.
Everything seems to be in order.
I hope ^CharacterName^ isn't screwing around again.
I wonder how ^CharacterName^ is doing.
Doing your job? Good.
Everything's fine? Good.
I'm tired, I'd better go to bed.
I need some rest...
I'll try to have some sleep...
Enough sleeping.
I can't sleep...
I haven't been able to sleep soundly since the shelling started...
I'll let some air into the room...
I wonder what the weather's like tonight...
No suspicious people outside...? Good, we don't need any more trouble.
I wonder if those buildings are empty.
It's cold, I'd better close the window.
All right, there's still plenty to do.
My legs went numb.
I need to sit down for a while.
It isn't the comfiest seat, but it has to do.
Just one more minute.
I miss the old days...
It doesn't make any sense.
When will it end?
Well, I can't sit forever.
There are more important things to do...
I'm so thirsty...
Good I have this bottle...
It's not easy to get water these days...
I'll save the rest for later.
Glad I have this book.
A little break for another chapter...
I hope I won't have to burn this book...
I miss going to the library.
I should check on that patient...
That patient wasn't looking good...
Let's replace that, you'll feel more comfortable.
Here, it's your medication.
You look better.
Let me know if you need something.
You will surely get better soon.
Did someone call me...?
That patient needs me!
I'll do what I can...
I know it hurts, you must stay strong.
It's all I can do, there's not enough medicines.
I wish there was more I could do...
We lost a lot of supplies during the shelling...
I feel so powerless...
I just need to be alone for a minute...
I... I need to check something...
Why... Why does it happen to me...?
I can't... I won't take it anymore...
Please, let it end... Let it end already...
Alright... I gotta hold on.
It's better now. Guess I just needed that.
Enough, I can't be such a crybaby.
Oh... Excuse me...
I... I was just looking for something...
Bloody vermin!
Repulsive!
This place is crawling with these disgusting creatures!
There is no hope...
I feel so miserable...
In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti...
Lord, grant us strength to endure this trial...
And to forgive those who trespass against us...
So help us God. Amen.
For peace and freedom! Cheers!
Let's see... Where did I finish?
I miss the dishes we ate before the war...
A simple exercise to stay fit.
Time for some exercise!
Some warm up exercise will do me good.
That feels much better.
Phew... that wasn't easy.
Gotta stay fit.
Bring it on, punk!
I'm not finished with you!
Son of a...
Fuck!
There's a dead body here!
A corpse... what happened here?
^CharacterName^, no!
^CharacterName^... shit... shit...
No! Those fuckers will pay!
They got ^CharacterName^!
Man down!
No! No! What's going on?!
This is insane! Why did they kill {mr|him}{fr|her}?!
No! Why?!
Are we next...?
No, it can't be! Please, speak to me!
No... no... please...
^CharacterName^, don't leave me!
No, ^CharacterName^, I don't believe this...
^CharacterName^, no!
Why did you do that?!
Murderer!
You're dead, you hear me?!
Fucking murderer!
No! You murderer!
No! What have you done?!
Please, stop it!
I've had enough...
Please, don't kill me.
Please, you can't do it, {mr|man}{fr|girl}...
Did someone touch the door? Strange...
Was someone using that door?
What the... did I leave the door open?
Someone must've been here!
Someone must be inside!
What's that noise?
I hear something.
Someone's there?
What's that sound?
Must be that intruder!
I thought {mr|he}{fr|she} fled!
{mr|He}{fr|She}'s still there!
What?! Gunshots?
Someone just shot!
I heard a gun!
I'd better go check it.
I'm gonna check this noise.
Is anyone there?
Probably something outside.
Nothing to worry about.
I won't jump at every noise.
Damned rats!
It's just my imagination.
I hope it's just the wind...
It's probably that {mr|guy}{fr|woman} racketing.
Why does {mr|he}{fr|she} make so much noise?
What is {mr|he}{fr|she} up to? I hope nothing dangerous.
What was that?!
What happened?!
What... No!
What was... Oh no!
Put your weapon down! Now!
Put it down! I won't warn you again.
Put it down or you'll regret this!
Put it down, please...
Please, put the weapon down...
What are you doing...? Put it down.
I see you came to your senses.
Don't try this again!
Please, don't do that again.
I hope you won't do this again.
Get the fuck out of here!
You better run {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}, while you still can!
This is our place! Leave!
Hey, get out!
Last warning, get out!
Leave now! Last warning!
Get out now, damn thief!
Get out! Get out!
You were supposed to leave! Get out now!
What are you doing here again?! Leave now!
Don't even try anything stupid. Just leave.
You heard that, get out now!
I've got my eye on you.
^CharacterName^, what's going on? Who is this?
Someone got in? Make {mr|him}{fr|her} leave.
That's right, stay away.
Don't try this again.
Just keep the distance, okay?
Good, I see we have an understanding...
Don't come any closer.
This is our place, keep away.
Hey, what are you looking for? Step back!
Get out of there and leave!
Don't act stupid, just leave.
Hey, keep away from that!
What are you doing?! Don't touch our stuff!
Are you trying to steal from us?
Did {mr|he}{fr|she} leave?
What is {mr|he}{fr|she} up to...?
What do you think you're doing?!
Stop that at once!
What the hell are you doing?!
Stop it! That's mine!
Thief!
You thieving bastard!
You won't get away with this!
^CharacterName^, help!
^CharacterName^, come quick!
^CharacterName^, someone's here!
^CharacterName^, someone got in!
On my way!
I'm coming!
I'll deal with it!
^CharacterName^, the intruder is back!
Someone's here again!
^CharacterName^, help! They got in again!
^CharacterName^, run!
^CharacterName^, hide somewhere!
They might be hiding here...
Looks promising, ^CharacterName^. We may find something nice.
Did you find someone, ^CharacterName^?
Did you find something, ^CharacterName^?
Not yet.
Nothing interesting.
Yeah, I think we'll find them here.
Yeah, I heard they stashed some stuff here.
We should go back, ^CharacterName^.
Right, let's go!
I should go back.
Should be enough for both of us, don't worry.
I'm calling for help!
Help! Help!
...but you can't enter. What have you got?
Hey, pal! You need some materials? Maybe wood?
Rum! Whiskey! Bourbon! Just kidding, I've got vodka only!
Need some medical supplies? I was a nurse in hospital once.
Fresh vegetables! Meat that will make your mouth water! Finest cans!
Hi. I have some things to exchange, wanna see?
Hey, I've got something you'll like.
It's a pleasure doing business with you!
I hope you'll change your mind.
So, shall we trade...?
Wanna exchange or not?
Stop!
Stop! Don't move!
Hey, you!
I need someone here!
We have an intruder!
Hey, ^CharacterName^!
Hi ^CharacterName^.
I'll get help!
I'll call the guys!
Hey, we have an intruder!
Move, someone's here!
Going there!
On my way!
I can't let {mr|him}{fr|her} through!
I'll stay there and defend.
I'm out of bullets!
It was my last mag!
No ammo!
Come closer, punk!
What are you waiting for, you {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}!
I'm waiting for you!
I'd better stay here.
I'll stay here!
What's {mr|he}{fr|she} up to? I better wait here...
I'll guard this area!
Give me all your weapons!
Are you armed? Give up your weapons!
Enough of this, get out! Now!
I'll let you go this time. Next time I'll kill you.
Go while you still can.
Do what we said. We don't want to kill you.
Are you deaf? Get the fuck out!
Go, before we change our minds!
Don't worry, {mr|he}{fr|she}'s gone.
Calm down, it's safe.
It's ok, {mr|he}{fr|she} won't bother you anymore.
You'll regret this!
You shouldn't have done that!
You made a mistake!
Hey! I brought something for you!
Anyone there? I brought you something!
I've got something for you! Open the door!
Hey! I need help! Please, open.
Help! Please, help me!
Help! Anyone there? I need help!
Hey! I have some stuff to exchange.
Open up, I brought something for barter!
Hey! I have something you'll like...
Hi, I came to thank you!
Open up please, I just want to thank you!
Can you open up? It won't take much time!
I think you might need it...
Why not take it?
Don't be afraid!
Please, help...
Have a heart!
Open the door, please...
Let me in, we can make a good deal.
Come on, I know you're there...
I'm not armed, I just wanna trade.
For crying out loud, it's dangerous outside!
You know how much I risked to get here?
Let's make a deal!
Have a look at what I brought...
It wasn't easy to get here, so let's make it worth the effort.
May I have a word with you?
Please, listen to me.
Have you got a moment?
I have something for you, let's talk.
It'll take just a minute.
Come on, I need to be going soon!
Let's talk, you won't regret it!
Oh, come on, I can't stand here all day.
Will you help me...?
Please, I need your help...
Don't turn your back on me, please...
Please, have a heart!
Are we gonna trade or what?
So, what is it gonna be?
Come on, I haven't got all day.
Well?
I'll go now, good luck.
Time to go, I'll try to visit you again.
Gotta go back to my folks...
This part of town is dangerous, but I'll try to come again.
I hope snipers won't see me...
I hope this helps you.
We've got to help each other!
Great, see you around!
Thank you!
I'm so grateful!
Thank you so much!
Need anything else?
I'll be here if you need anything more.
Thanks! But I have more, take a look!
As you wish. I'll go to someone else.
So be it. See you around.
Have it your way. Goodbye.
You won't help me? I'm very disappointed...
I thought more highly of you...
I didn't expect you'd turn your back on me...
You're wasting my time...
You'll regret your decision later...
You won't make it if your provisions run out.
I understand... I'll try elsewhere.
I'm sorry to hear that...
What a pity...
All right, take your time...
I understand you need to think about it...
Let me know when you've decided.
Are you sure you don't want it?
Don't you need it?
Are you sure you can't help me?
Please, maybe you can change your mind?
Are you sure you don't want to trade?
You won't change your mind? We could both benefit...
It'll be alright, they didn't say no.
What's going on?
Hey, what happened?
What...?
Someone shot me!
I got shot!
Help! I got wounded!
Oh God, I'm bleeding!
Got smokes?
I need cigarettes badly. Please don't hide them. I can tell if you do.
Lack of smokes is driving me insane, give me some or you’ll get hurt!
Was someone rummaging through my things? If I get my hands on them…
Did they try to rob me again? Let’s check…
I have to keep those fucking thugs at bay.
It was so much easier with Nadia, but I’ll get on just fine on my own! She’ll see!
I don’t know who is worse, the bloody snipers or the damn looters!
I’d kill all those motherfuckers if I could get my hands on them!
Too dangerous, she said. I’ll prove her wrong!
I see you've hidden cigarettes under your skin. Give them to me or i kill You!
Give me those smokes or I’ll take them from your cold dead hands!
Good... This will clear my karma.
See? A bit of special smoke, and they are gone! Haha, gone!
Enough Mr nice guy, I’m gonna kill you!
Die {mr|bastard}{fr|bitch}!
What was that? Fucking thieves again?
You came to steal from me? I’ll kill you!
Was someone here, or am I hearing things? Get a grip man.
Hmm… If someone was here, they got away.
Who are you? What the fuck are you doing in my home?
Trying to steal from me? Not this time!

I bring good news!
I'm back! It went well.

The upcoming days should still be nice and warm. Perfect for a stroll in the park!
It's cool outside, with clouds and possibly rainfall. Our advice for cold evenings is: grab a good book and a hot cup of tea and relax in your armchair by the fireplace.
Overcast over the entire South-East Graznavia. It is getting colder every day. Make sure you have enough firewood if central heating is unavailable where you live.
It is cold. Unfortunately, higher temperatures are not expected over the next couple of days, so make sure to keep the fire going day and night.
Temperatures are still very low. In besieged Pogoren, firewood is getting harder to come by and people are gathering anything that can be burned.
We are happy to announce it is getting warmer. The temperatures should continue to rise in the upcoming days. This may bring some relief to the citizens of Pogoren.
The temperatures are going to plummet in the upcoming days. It will get extremely cold, as if the war wasn't enough.
Winter holds us firmly in its icy grip. Many people froze to death in the recent days. The only upside is the decrease in crime, as even the bandits huddle in their homes.
The next few days should be warm and pleasant, if a little bit windy.
We are expecting the temperatures to gradually increase in the upcoming days. A welcome change indeed!
Is there anything nicer than a warm sunny day? There probably is, but it doesn’t hurt to appreciate the little things, so go outside and enjoy the weather!
It’s our pleasure to report that the next couple of days are expected to be quite warm.
We may expect the upcoming days to be quite cool. One of our listeners suggests there's nothing better than a cup of hot mulled wine on a cool day. Enjoy!

No surprises when it comes to weather: It will be cloudy, with high chances for snowfall and the temperatures below zero.

It is getting colder every day. Remember, central heating is not yet operational everywhere, so make sure you have enough firewood.

We can expect at least a week of warm weather, before the winter cold starts setting in.
As if war wasn't enough, crime is on the rise in the city of Pogoren. There are reports of armed assaults and robberies.
If you live in Pogoren, be advised to remain at home and lock your doors. Armed bands have taken to the streets.
Bands of looters are on the rampage, attacking homes every night. Extreme vigilance is advised.
Civic self-defense guard patrols have put an end to the wave of crimes in Pogoren. The worst is over, but it doesn't hurt to remain vigilant.
The city of Pogoren is suffering extreme shortages of even the most vital supplies. If this goes on, people will soon become scavengers, scouring the city for anything of use.
People are scouring the streets and abandoned houses for everything that can be eaten, burned or traded. If aid doesn't reach the city soon, the situation will become dire.
Famine and disease reign over the ravaged city of Pogoren. Death takes heavy toll due with no access to food, clean water and medical supplies.
The rebels' spokesman informed us that some districts might become inaccessible to civilians because the government forces are planning to storm the city. They hope to end the fighting before the international intervention.
The rebel and government forces are engaged in violent skirmishes throughout the city. Some areas have been completely cut off, while others witness heavy fighting.
Having suffered heavy losses, the military retreated to their previous positions and resumed the strategy of avoiding direct confrontation. Movement around the city should once again be possible.
Despite desperate counterattacks by the rebels trying to lift the siege of the capital, the city remains cut off. The spokesman for the military said that shelling, winter, and lack of supplies should force the defenders to surrender.
The international community has undertaken negotiations regarding the possibility of military intervention in Graznavia to force a ceasefire and allow aid to reach the civilian population.

We interrupt our broadcast to inform you of a tragic incident. This morning a mortar shell exploded in the marketplace, killing over sixty people and wounding many more.
Let us commemorate the victims of yesterday's marketplace shelling with a moment of silence.
The tragedy of the recent marketplace shelling caused a worldwide anti-war uproar. Among the casualties there were both Vyseni and Grazni people.
We are disappointed to bring you the news but the promised international intervention has been indefinitely postponed.
In the face of indecisiveness of the international community, the officials of neighbouring Gramodian Federation announced that it would undertake the task of protecting Vyseni people from Grazni persecutions and ending the civil war within a week.

Coffee is becoming less and less available in the besieged city of Pogoren. The prices of coffee on the black market are expected to rise.
Most of us can't imagine starting a day without a cup of coffee. In Pogoren it has become an almost unavailable commodity. The prices skyrocketed and speculators are the ones who profit.
Thanks to some humanitarian aid drops, coffee is once again available in Pogoren. It remains an expensive commodity but its prices no longer border on extortion.
Cigarettes and tobacco are presently used in Pogoren as currency. Nonetheless, the city is running short on them. What will happen if they run out completely?
Due to recent shortages, the prices of cigarettes and tobacco have become exceedingly high. Many people need cigarettes to calm down, but how can they be calm knowing how much they must pay for them?
Cigarettes and tobacco are available in Pogoren once more. How this exactly came about remains a mystery. Theories include smugglers, corrupt military officials and foreign aid.
Medical supplies are among the most sought-after products in Pogoren. Due to high demand and low supply, their prices are expected to become inflated by speculators.
The current limited availability of medical supplies result in many people resorting to theft. Death from wounds or disease has sadly become much more common.
Thanks to the international humanitarian aid, medical supplies reappeared in Pogoren. Unfortunately, the rebel forces seize the lion's share, and the civilian population struggles to get any.
Fresh vegetables are becoming a rare commodity in Pogoren. Their prices will gradually be rising, according to our analysts.
Getting fresh vegetables in Pogoren has become more difficult than ever. Most of the transport trucks fall into the hands of the military or the rebels.
The vegetable crisis seems to be at an end. International aid trucks laden mostly with turnips, beets and potatoes have recently reached the city.

Hello, neighbors!
We live several blocks from here. We saw that you took refuge in this building, and since we're supposed to be neighbors, we decided to pay you a visit and say hello. We brought you some vegetables from our garden. Enjoy!
Will you help us reinforce our shelter?
Hello, it's us again. The military intensified shelling of our area and we decided we need to reinforce our improvised shelter in the cellar. We've got the necessary materials, but we could use an extra pair of hands. Maybe you could help us?
Thank you for your help!
We've come to see how you're doing and to thank you for your help. It feels much safer to sleep in our own reinforced shelter. Especially since several houses in the neighborhood area were hit by artillery shells. We were saving this bottle for some special occasion, but we discussed it and decided to give it to you, instead.
Please, help me bury my husband.
My husband is dead. Killed by an artillery shell. There was nothing I could do. What I can do now is give him a proper funeral. The snipers are known for firing at mourners, so it might be dangerous. But it needs to be done. Will you help me?
Our mom needs medications.
We live several blocks away from here, our mom's very ill, she needs medications, could you please spare any? Without your help she will die! After daddy went to fight, we have only her... Please, help us save her...
We're hungry!
Hi again! Thanks to you our mum is getting better, but she is still weak and we have no food left. We are very hungry. Can you give us something to eat, please?
Take our mother to hospital!
It's about our mother! We didn't find any medicine for her and now she's very, very sick! Please, you must take her to hospital! Please!
Thank you so much!
Thank you for your help, I feel much better now. I'd rather not think what would happen to my children if you hadn't helped me.</n>We haven't got much, but I saved up some coffee for my husband. He loves it, but he hasn't been home for a long time now. He's somewhere out there fighting and who knows when he can return, so why don't you take it instead?
Have you found some food for us?
We're very hungry, our tummies hurt. We can't find anything good to eat, so we've been eating all sorts of gross things in the last couple of days. Can you share some real food with us, please? Pretty please?
Have you got medicine for mom?
Mummy is getting weaker every day, she can't wait any longer! Please, can you give us medicine for her? Please!
Save people from a collapsed building!
Thank goodness you're here! A shell hit a tenement down the street and people are buried beneath the rubble. Please, help me pull them out! Every pair of hands is needed. We will organize a makeshift hospital for the wounded at my home. I have some beds and medical supplies. Will you help?
Can you spare some bandages?
Hello again. How are you doing? Thanks to your help all the wounded recovered and went back to their homes. One of them still needs bandages though, and I've run out. Could you spare any?
Thank you for saving my father!
Hi, you don't know me, but my father told me how you'd helped pull him out from the collapsed building and shared some bandages with him. If not for you, he would be dead now. I don't know how to thank you! I haven't got much, but please take these earrings. They belonged to my mother.
What about those bandages?
It's me again, have you managed to get those bandages we spoke about? You'll save that man's life.
Can you help me with something?
Hi there, neighbor. You aren't from around here, are you? I've come to tell you that there's an abandoned house nearby. The owners fled the city long ago when it was still possible. If you help me get inside, we might find something of value there. What do you say?
Perhaps you'll help me again?
It's me again. Last time it went quite well, so I thought you might want to help me again. I know of a rich family who managed to stock up on supplies before the war, but they selfishly don't share with anybody. Maybe we should pay them a visit?
You can't miss this opportunity!
There's another job. This time it's a real gold seam. It's a bit risky, but really worth it. A hospital warehouse, full of medical supplies! It's only lightly guarded at night - we can deal with that. Let's go!
I've got interesting news!
Good day to you! I live down the street and I noticed you're living in this abandoned building. I've got some news. There was a humanitarian aid drop last night. Most containers were confiscated by the rebels, but I know about one they missed. It landed in no man's land so it might be dangerous to get to it but under the cover of darkness we should be able to make it. I'll show you where it is if you help me carry supplies. Deal?
We're looking for a thief, do you know anything?
Citizens, several days ago someone from this neighborhood stole supplies from a humanitarian aid container. Those supplies are vital to us. There's a reward for help in seizing the culprit. One of your neighbors was reportedly sniffing around the container and we have reasons to believe he took those supplies. Can you confirm our suspicions?
Thanks for your solidarity!
Good to see you again! Thank you for not reporting on me to the rebel soldiers. You're good people. Please accept these cigarettes as a small token of my gratitude. They're really good, American!
Can you help me board up my windows?
I live nearby with my daughter. I've heard rumors of looters pillaging houses and raping women. I can lock the doors but they could get inside through the windows. Can you help me board them up? My husband was taken by the rebels in the first year of the war and hasn't returned yet. We're all alone, please help us!
Can you protect us, please?
It's me again. Yesterday, I saw a band of shady-looking types watching my house. I'm so scared! They might try to rob us or worse. I have a teenage daughter! Can you please protect us for a night or two? You can use my husband's hunting shotgun.
We're moving, thank you for everything.
Thank you so much for protecting us. My sister and her husband came to visit us. They live in another part of town and invited us to stay with them. I think we'll be safer there, so we're leaving. But before we go, I wanted to thank you and give you my husband's shotgun along with the rest of our ammunition. We won't need it anymore, I hope.
Can you help us now?
It's me again! It's getting more dangerous every day, can you please help us secure our house?
Can I stay with you?
I have some wood to spare
We have to help each other, especially in times like these. I had some trees in the garden, but it's getting colder every day, so I decided to cut them for firewood, before anyone else would. I can share some of it with you. Maybe next time you will help me out, eh?
I've got food to share
You won't believe it, but some charity organization was handing out food in the market square! I thought they'd given up on us. I took as much as they would give before Grazni mortars started firing and everyone had to run for cover. I was lucky to have made it.
Will you save my books?
I am moving to a different part of the city with my family. We took all we could carry, but we have to leave some things behind, including my large collection of books. Maybe I could leave them with you for safekeeping? Otherwise, I'm afraid someone will burn them when it gets cold. They could help you pass the time, and I'd come back for them after the fighting is over. What do you say?
I need help with guarding my house
Recently, I saw a band of shady-looking types watching my house. I'm so scared! They might try to rob us, or worse. I have a teenage daughter! My husband was doing a good job of protecting us, but he went to search for food and hasn't returned, yet. Can you or one of your friends please protect us for a night or two? You can use my husband's hunting rifle.
Our mom needs medications
We live several blocks away from here, our mom's very ill, she needs medications. Could you please spare any? Without your help she will die! After daddy was killed we have only our mom... Please, help us save her...
I need help with my wife's funeral
It's about my wife... She was gathering firewood when she was shot by a sniper. There was nothing I could do to help her. The least we can do now is give her a proper funeral... Let's show those bastards that they can't take away our dignity and that we're not afraid of snipers. Will you come with me?
Could you keep these meds for my friend?
I'm looking for my friend, Anna. She used to live here before the war. I was hoping to see her. She was always rather sickly and medications are getting ever harder to come by, so I brought her some. Maybe you could keep them and give them to her if she comes?
Help! My brother is wounded!
You're the first person who opened the door, thank you so much! Quickly, my brother was shot by a sniper! Please, help me carry him home, or he'll die! There's no time to lose!
Bitter cold will make it much more difficult for us to survive.

Canadian-American artist Gabriel “Specter” Reese as a kid sketched and painted the streets of Montreal. Nowadays his work has been featured in countless gallery shows and he’s been commissioned to do several large public works in Brooklyn and Manhattan.
Since the early nineties, SeaCreative whose real name is Fabrizio Sarti has been painting walls and train cars in and around Milan, Italy. Today SeaCreative paints and shows his own characters, not just in the more conventional setting of an exhibition, but still throughout the urban setting of Milan.
Emir personally experienced war as a boy. He began to repulse the hatred for war by crushing charcoal on large formats. His compositions are reflections on human condition and our society during the war.
M-City is a project of Mariusz Waras, born 1978 in Gdynia, Poland. His projects including several hundred murals, may be seen in the streets of Warsaw, Gdańsk, Berlin, Paris, Jakarta, Sao Paulo, New York, Bolzano, London and Prague, as well as in art galleries.
Man behind M-City project Mariusz Waras is is also a curator of the 238x504 billboard gallery in Gdynia as well as an archivist and collector of Polish street art.
Fauxreel is a self tought Canadian artist. He creates stunning photo based street art to provoke reflection upon many issues like identity, social relationships and the spaces that we inhabit.
Mariusz Waras is also a freelance graphic artist, frequently awarded in various contests. In 2008 Tristan Manco, an international art expert included him in the official list of the worlds's most important artists of the stencil-graffiti scene.
In the street, Specter is known for precise installations that revitalize forgotten places. The work is as much about the piece as it is about where it is placed. He specifically chooses the environments for his work and it often evolves to reflect the chosen location.
Large formats that Emir utilizes in his work allowed for better impact making very contrasted images quite impressive in an expressionist way.
Mateusz Walus is a young and very talented artist from Poland. He is insanely passionate about art and games. Mateusz created some of the graphics used in This War of Mine.

How are we to fight the odds if we fight each other?
Control Scheme
Swing
It's just a simple swing, but for a kid it's a never-ending source of fun.
Kids' desk
It's important for kids to have their own place in the shelter. They can draw here, read books and play with toys. It helps them forget about the war.
Toy Box
It contains everything! A teddy bear, dolls, pocket planes and cars. Even toy soldiers...
Snowman
Winter is harsh for adults, but for kids it's a time to play.
Ball
Which child doesn't like to play with a ball?
Jump Rope
It's amazing how a simple piece of rope can keep children entertained for so many hours.
Broken Toy
This toy has seen better days. It's broken now, but it certainly brought a lot of joy to its previous owner.
I really like it when it's warm.
I'd better not touch it, it's really, really hot.
My friend's parents have a big, stone fireplace.
There's still nothing inside...
Oh come on! How long do I have to wait?
Stupid trap, it's not working.
Drop after drop after drop... Waiting is so boring...
I should check it later, maybe it will be full then.
I wonder if it's supposed to take so long.
I could stand here all day and watch it dripping.
They're planted. What now?
I could stand here all day and watch it dripping.
I really hope it will be something other than a carrot.
It's cold and not very tasty.
I'd rather have some chocolate or candy...
Why can't I have it cooked?
Aren't we supposed to cook it first?
Yuck, I don't like it.
What is it? It tastes awful!
It says it's meat, but it's fat and icky...
Do I have to eat it? It's really bland and dull…
It tastes much better than canned food.
This isn't very yummy, but I'm hungry...
It's nice to have something warm to eat.
I'd prefer some fast food, but this is ok.
Come on, this is it? Raw vegetables?
I'd prefer some pizza or pie...
I don't like vegetables, but I'm hungry.
I don't want to go to bed yet!
I'm not sleepy!
I don't wanna sleep now.
I can't stick anythng more in there.
The water turned into ice...
There's nothing left to burn.
My tummy is full!
I can't eat any more.
I'm not supposed to touch these without permission.
I feel fine, let's save the meds for later.
I need a grown-up to help me with this.
I'm fine, we might need these bandages someday.
I'm too small to do that.
Maybe a grown-up can help me with this?
I'd better call someone to do that.
I wish I was older, I could do everything myself.
No... I don't want to play now.
I'm not in the mood...
I don't want to play alone...
No... Maybe there's something better to do?
I don't know how to use it, but I can learn.
Maybe someone can teach me how to use it.
If I learn how to use it, I can help around the house.
I'd like to learn how to use this.
It won't move. Maybe it's a magic door to a treasure room?
Abracadabra! Open Sesame! Mellon!
I wonder if we need a magic key to open this door.
Maybe a grown-up can open it?
It's locked, I wonder what's on the other side?
A Viking warrior could break through this door!
It won't move. Maybe it's a magic door to a treasure room?
Abracadabra! Open Sesame! Mellon!
I wonder if we need a magic key to open this door.
Maybe a grown-up can open it?
It's locked, I wonder what's on the other side?
A Viking warrior could break through this door!
I'd love to be a wizard. I would blast this door with a fireball spell!
I wish I were as strong as a superhero so I could break this door!
If I had a laser sword I could cut right through this door!
Maybe this door could be opened from the other side?
This door can't stop me, I'm {ms|superman}{fs|wonder woman}!
I saw a film where dinosaurs smashed through doors like these! Roarrr!
Watch me break this barricade!
What's on the other side of this pile of rubble? I gotta know!
Let's embark on a journey to the other side of this pile of rubble!
I'm not supposed to play with rubble, it may be dangerous.

The civil war in Graznavia has been raging for years now. The last stronghold of the rebel forces is under siege by the government military. Countless civilians are stranded in the city. Food and vital resources are running out, and every day is a struggle for survival.</n></n>Christo and his daughter Iskra were driven from their home by soldiers. In search of a place to stay, they chanced upon an abandoned building and decided to make it their temporary home.
Every day is a struggle for survival in besieged Pogoren. Snipers prowl the city. Shellings are frequent. Crime is on the rise as supplies are becoming ever harder to come by. To make things worse, winter is setting in and there is no central heating.</n></n>In these dire circumstances, old Henrik is trying to keep his grandson Ivano alive and well. While searching for shelter they met Arica, a girl who came to Pogoren fleeing military persecution. They decided to stick together for the time being, and have been occupying a recently abandoned building.
^CharacterName^, what's wrong?
Are you sad?
I'm not sad, I am just a little tired.
Can you promise me something?
Yes?
Don't be sad, please. Cheer up ^CharacterName^.
Okay, I'll try.
I'll try, I promise.
Please, don't be sad.
...
When you're sad, I'm sad too.
I just need to rest... a bit more.
We could play a game if you like.
What game?
I'll be a rebel and you'll ask me all kinds of questions.
Oh no...
And if I say a word, I lose. But no tickling!
Could we play a guessing game instead?
^CharacterName^...
What is it?
Why are you sad?
I... I think about things. Too much.
I think too much too. Can I think with you?
Sure.
But let's only think about nice things.
All right!
Hey ^CharacterName^, don't be so blue!
I'm here for you whenever you need me. What's wrong?
I... I know. I miss my friends...
I even miss going to school.
The war will end quickly, you'll see.
You promise?
I promise, we just have to wait.
Hey ^CharacterName^...
You're not crying, are you?
I... I...
You're a big {mr|boy}{fr|girl} now, and big {mr|boys}{fr|girls} don't cry!
You won't tell anyone I was crying, right?
I won't, don't worry. But be a brave {mr|boy}{fr|girl} now, okay?
Okay...
There you are {mr|buddy}{fr|dear}!
Hey, why do you look so glum?
It's horrible here... I don't want to be here anymore!
We can't leave the city yet, but it won't be long now.
How do you know?
I think I heard it on the radio, or at the market.
Really? How much longer do we have to stay here?
Not very long, you'll see!
Why do you look so grim ^CharacterName^?
You're not the only who has it hard you know.
I know, but I feel so lonely...
And I'm really scared. I don't want to die!
Everyone has to die one day, kid. Don't be a coward, get a grip!
But... but...
Oh come on, stop crying already!
What are you going to do after the war?
I don't know...
I'll go to Paris. Do you know what's there?
No.
Not one, but TWO theme parks. Aaaand...
...they're trying to outdo each other ALL the time.
Can I go with you?
We'll see... You'd have to behave...
I will, I promise!
^CharacterName^, do you want to hear a story?
...
There was once a Mouse who was very scared of a Cat.
She lived in a small hole in the wall.
Like us...
And she also only dared to go out at night.
But one day, she heard that the Cat is no more!
And she lived happily ever after?
No. She died of overeating.
But she died happy!
Oh yeah!
What's wrong, ^CharacterName^?
I miss school.
It took a war to hear a kid say that.
No, I mean, I miss my friends.
I miss my friends too. But it's not all bad.
How so?
I have new friends now.
...
And when it's over, we'll have even more friends.
Really? Who?
All the people who will have lived through this will be our friends.
Hey, ^CharacterName^, what's up?
Nothing.
Look, I got a kitten for you!
It's a piece of rug.
But it needs a hug!
That's stupid.
...
I know you wanted to make me laugh. I'm sorry.
I just... Everything will be fine, you'll see.
^CharacterName^, what's the matter?
I'm scared.
Me too. But I won't give up.
Does dying hurt?
You are not going to die!
It does.
Sometimes. But I will not let you die.
Grown-ups lie all the time.
...
I promise I'll do everything to protect you.
You know, I fell from a tree when I was little.
I did too. So what?
But did you fall on someone?
I fell on my teacher.
On someone?
Really?
Yeah. He came to ask me why I wasn’t at school.
Wow!
And I broke his collarbone.
He must have been really mad at you.
I don't know. I changed schools.
Stop moaning, ^CharacterName^.
I don't want to be here anymore!
You have no idea how lucky you are.
What?
Others have it much worse.
So what!
At least we have a home.
This is no home!
It's the best we have.
I hate you!
Well, that's better. No more sniveling!
^CharacterName^, quit moping.
I'm not.
You're moping like a moper.
What's a moper?
You are. A proper moper.
Don't call me that!
Hey, it's not my fault!
If I were big, I would...
You would mope the floor with me!
You bet I would!
Hello {mr|mister}{fr|ma'am}.
Will you live with us now?
Yes, it seems I will.
Yaaay! I can show you around if you like.
You are very kind, thank you.
You look so tired, are you ok?
I'm a little weak.
But I will be alright, so cheer up.
Okay, I will find a potion of strength for you!
What does this new thing do?
I can't tell you, it's a secret!
Oh come on! Tell me, tell me, tell me!
Tell me!
I'm sorry to tell you this, but...
No! It's not true! You're lying!
I'm scared!
Don't worry, everything will be alright.
These people will take good care of you, you'll see!
What are you doing?
I'm working right now. I'm very busy...
...so go play somewhere else, ok?
But I want to play with you...
What are you doing ^CharacterName^?
Not now. I'm busy.
But I'll help! I can help.
I know you can. But not now.
^CharacterName^, will you play with me?
Sorry kiddo, I can't now. Maybe later.
^CharacterName^! I just saw the biggest rat ever! Come! I will show you...
It's fine. Just be careful. I'll see it later.
Hey, what are you doing? Can we do something together?
Nothing important. Yes, I think we can.
Yay!
Go and think of a riddle, and I'll try to answer it, ok?
Okay!
Do you know how to fight?
I sure do.
Cool! Will you teach me?
I will, but later, ok?
Okay.
I’m scared ^CharacterName^, can you hug me?
Of course, come over here. There’s no need to be scared…
…everything will be fine.
You promise?
I promise.
^CharacterName^, why do people kill other people?
Because... they forgot how to talk.
But we didn't forget ^CharacterName^, did we?
No kiddo, we didn't. We can still talk.
When I grow up, I want to be a sniper.
Don't you ever say such a thing!
But, ^CharacterName^...
End of discussion.
^CharacterName^... who makes all the bombs? Are they people?
Yes, other people make them.
But they're not like us, are they?
Look ^CharacterName^, I caught a roach!
That's very nice ^CharacterName^, but I'm busy right now.
You can show me your bugs later, ok?
I'm gonna find the biggest bug ever!
When will you take me to the circus?
I want to see the trained bears.
I'm sorry, the circus is closed now.
We can go there on your birthday, okay?
But that's such a looong wait...
Hey {mr|little buddy}{fr|dear}. What have you got there?
Look ^CharacterName^, it's the biggest bug on Earth!
Just make sure it doesn't run away.
Okay, I will look after it!
That's my {mr|boy}{fr|girl}!
^CharacterName^...
Yes dear? You look sad...
I'm afraid to go and play outside.
Why don't we play inside instead?
Okay...
Come back later, I'll have a riddle for you!
How are you doing {mr|buddy}{fr|dear}?
Okay I guess. When will the war be over?
I don't know for sure, but I hope it will be soon.
So you don't know.
Not yet, but I'll tell you as soon as I know, okay?
Okay...
What's up {mr|buddy}{fr|dear}?
Can you brush my hair ^CharacterName^?
Yes, did you bring a hairbrush?
Yay! I did! Here you are!
Good {mr|boy}{fr|girl}! Gosh, your hair's messy.
I know, right?
Don't worry, we'll fix it.
What's up, ^CharacterName^?
Will you tell me a story?
What story would you like to hear?
About the Vikings!
Hmm... The seagulls were crying overhead, as the warriors set sail.
Eric was standing at the prow of his longship...
Hey ^CharacterName^, why don't we do something fun together?
No! I don't want to play now...
Why not, what's wrong?
It's just... I'm scared... please don't go out at night!
Sometimes I have to, but I'll try to stay in tonight.
Hey ^CharacterName^, do you wanna play?
No… I’m not in the mood…
Why? What's wrong?
Everything's wrong!
I know it's hard and you miss your friends, but you'll see them soon.
You promise?
I promise, and tonight I'll try to bring you something nice, okay?
Okay.
You look pale, is everything alright?
No, it's not.
Tell me what's wrong.
Everything! I can't go to school and see my friends, I can't go outside to play...
You'll go back to school as soon as the war is over, I promise.
And I’ll be allowed to play with my friends?
Of course, my dear.
Would you like to play, kid?
I’m not a kid anymore!
Okay, okay I understand... So?
I just want to talk.
Okay, what's up?
Will the soldiers ever go away?
Of course, we just have to be patient and brave.
And everything will be normal again?
It will. Don't worry about it now, ^CharacterName^.
Hey ^CharacterName^, let's play together!
I don’t want to play, I want people to stop fighting!
They will stop fighting eventually.
Yeah, right...
And when it happens, you'll see your friends again.
Really? I miss them. Do you think they're alright?
I'm sure they are!
Hey, ^CharacterName^!
Yes, ^CharacterName^…?
What’s wrong dear? Hey, were you crying?
No… It’s just… I had something in my eye, that’s all…
Hey, cheer up and I will tell you a story before bedtime, okay?
Okay, but only if you promise!
I promise!
Hey ^CharacterName^, do you wanna play?
Yes! I want to race to that room!
Ok, let's start then!
Yeah! I won!
You are super fast, you will become a great {mr|sportsman}{ms|sportswoman} for sure!
Hey ^CharacterName^, what game do you want to play?
Ehmm... Rock-paper-scissors!
Alright, let's play!
3... 2... 1... Go!
Hey kid, do you wanna play?
Yes! Let’s play rock-paper-scissors!
OK, let’s do it, ^CharacterName^!
Ready, steady, go!
You look bored, do you want to play something?
Can we play rock-paper-scissors? I really like it.
Sure, why not.
Prepare yourself! 3... 2... 1... Go!
I would like to play, but I don’t know what. Any suggestions, ^CharacterName^?
Rock-paper-scissors is great! Can I join?
I was hoping you'd ask.
Let’s start! 3... 2... 1... Go!
I won, I won!
I'm out of luck today.
Maybe next time you'll win.
Great! I won!
You're really good at this game!
So are you! Maybe next time you'll win.
Awesome! I won!
Next time will be different!
Let’s play again soon!
I lost again!
You're just out of luck today.
This is stupid...
No, not again!
Relax, you can't win every time.
But I can lose every time? That's unfair!
You're cheating!
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are!
Hey ^CharacterName^, do you wanna play rock-paper-scissors?
Alright, let's play!
Let’s play rock-paper-scissors!
OK, let’s do it, ^CharacterName^!
You look bored, do you want to play rock-paper-scissors?
Sure, why not.
I won, ^CharacterName^ I won!
I'm out of luck today, ^CharacterName^.
Great! I won!
You're really good at this game!
Awesome! I won!
Next time will be different!
What's up {mr|big guy}{fr|little princess}?
{ms|My spider ran away again.}{fs|I lost my lucky stone.}
{ms|That's probably because I didn't feed him today}{fs|It must be somewhere..}.
Where was {mr|he}{fr|it} the last time you saw {mr|him}{fr|it}? Let's look for {mr|him}{fr|it}!
I'll show you!
Found {mr|him}{fr|it}!
Thank you soooo much!
Let's play a game.
Whoever kills the most bugs, wins.
Okay.
3...2...1... Go!
I won!
Next time I'll be the winner!
That was disgusting!
Yes, I know!
That was silly...
You may be right... but I won!
You just had a better spot!
This is really stupid, I always lose!
We don't have to play, if you don't want to.
Have you seen any rats around?
I saw one a moment ago.
Come on, I'll show you!
It was sitting right here.
We need to get rid of them.
I will help!
Great! I'm counting on you.
^CharacterName^, I've got a riddle for you!
Which letter can hurt you if it gets too close?
A? Because it's spikey?
Bee!
I have a riddle for you ^CharacterName^!
I’m tall when I’m young and I’m short when I’m old. What am I?
A tree?
No. I'm a candle!
Can you answer my riddle ^CharacterName^?
What has four wheels and flies?
I don't know.
A garbage truck!
^CharacterName^, can you say: she sells seashells by the seashore?
She shells shesells by the sheesore.
^CharacterName^ say: how much wood would a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could chuck wood? I know this one!
^CharacterName^ say: Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
Peter Peper picked a peck of... what?
Pickled peppers!
That was fun ^CharacterName^!
Yeah, let's try it again tomorrow.
Do you wanna play a clapping game?
Sure!
Are you sick ^CharacterName^?
It's nothing serious.
Don't cry. I'm gonna be fine.
Promise me!
I promise you ^CharacterName^.
Does it hurt a lot?
Just a little bit.
But you'll be alright?
Of course I will.
I know this is hard for you, ^CharacterName^...
You know nothing! Leave me alone!
I understand that this is a terrible loss for you, but time will heal all wounds.
What do you know about it? It's not your loss!
Each one of us has lost someone or sacrificed something, but at least we have each other.
^CharacterName^?
This is all my fault!
What are you talking about?
I was angry and scared... and I wished...
I wished that something bad would happen, so we could go away from here...
Your wishes had nothing to do with what happened ^CharacterName^.
Sometimes bad things happen for no reason. It's not your fault.
Hey, ^CharacterName^.
Go away!
If there's anything I could...
You should have died instead!
We don't get to choose that.
It's unfair!
It is.
...I want to be alone...
Hey...
Leave me alone.
I'm worried about you.
I wish I had died instead.
You have to live.
I don't want to.
You must survive, or the bad people will win.
I don't care...
I will do anything to help you.
You can't help me. Nobody can.
Oh, ^CharacterName^...
^CharacterName^! You're back!
I see that you've been brave.
Of course, I'm almost a grown-up!
I missed you ^CharacterName^!
I missed you too ^CharacterName^!
I'm glad you're here.
I'm here for you.
Why are you so sad ^CharacterName^?
Did something bad happen?
Nothing, it's nothing.
^CharacterName^...
Is something wrong ^CharacterName^?
I don't like it when you have to go out at night ^CharacterName^...
I know dear, but I have to. Someone has to.
^CharacterName^! Why is your arm bleeding?
Don't worry, it's just a little scratch.
Are you sure you're gonna be ok?
Of course... Now tell me about your night. Did you sleep well?
No, I was worried about you...
You have a good heart ^CharacterName^, but you needn't worry. I'll be okay.
What happened ^CharacterName^?!
Oh, I had a bad adventure, but I'll be fine...
I'm worried about you!
I'll be fine, don't worry ^CharacterName^.
How can I not worry? You're bleeding!
I'll bandage the wound and I'll be alright.
^CharacterName^! Last night some bad guys came to steal our things!
Are you alright? Did they hurt you?
No... But don't leave me alone again!
Don't worry sweetheart, I will protect you now.
You have to!
I will.
How could you leave me? Some evil men came to take our things! And you weren't here!
My God! Are you okay?
Yes, but I was so scared...
I'm sorry I left you ^CharacterName^, I had to go look for supplies. But I'm here now.
And you won't leave me?
I won't.
^CharacterName^! ^CharacterName^! We were attacked last night!
What?! Are you hurt? What happened?
I started screaming and the burglar hit me really hard...
That son of a... How could he?!
I shouldn't have left you alone... Let me take care of you now.
^CharacterName^ help me!
What's wrong ^CharacterName^?
Someone came here last night to steal our things, and they hurt me! I hate them!
Bloody bastards! Here, let me have a look...
It hurts...
I know dear, but be brave. You'll be alright, I promise.
I'm glad you're back ^CharacterName^!
So am I! And I have something for you!
Really, what is it?
Look, we can make a new toy out of this!
^CharacterName^! Are you ok? I was worried...
I'm fine dear, and I have a surprise for you!
Let me see!
All the toy shops are closed, but look what I brought!
Wow, thank you ^CharacterName^!
^CharacterName^! Where were you?!
I went to get some food and...
You left me alone! And someone came here last night!
What are you saying?! Who was it?
I don't know! I was really scared! How could you leave me alone?!
I... I'm sorry dear, I won't leave you again.
I hate you ^CharacterName^!
What? Why are you saying this?!
Because you left me all alone at night!
I had to go out to look for supplies...
Someone was here during the night! They tried to hurt me!
My God, are you ok? I shouldn't have left you alone, I'm sorry ^CharacterName^...
Look ^CharacterName^, first you put some firewood here, see?
Okay, I see.
Next, you put a pot of water here.
Right here?
Yes. Then you add meat and chopped vegetables if you have them.
Remember to wash them first. Now you just have to let it boil.
I will!
Look ^CharacterName^, first you put some firewood here, see?
Okay, I see.
Just be careful not to burn your hand.
Next, you put a pot of water here, and wait until the water is boiling.
I’ll be careful, ^CharacterName^.
Yes. Then you add meat and chopped vegetables if you have them, but remember to wash them first.
Right here?
Now you just have to stir it every couple of minutes until it’s ready.
I will!
^CharacterName^, let me show you how to make water filters.
Okay, ^CharacterName^.
Watch me do it first.
It looks easy…
It is. Will you help me make these so that we have clean water?
I will!
Do you want to help me, ^CharacterName^?
Sure, ^CharacterName^!
Great! Let me teach you how to prepare fuel for the heater and stove.
Okay.
Wood works best, but if there isn’t any, you can use books or other components.
Books?
Only if really necessary, alright?
Alright.
Let me show you something, ^CharacterName^.
What’s that?
Look, that’s how we make fertilizer.
What do we need it for?
We use it for growing herbs or vegetables.
Oh, I see.
Here ^CharacterName^, I’ll teach you how to grow herbs in our garden.
Okay.
See, it’s not very difficult.
Yeah, I think I can do it…
Just remember to use some fertilizer and water.
I get it.
Would you like to learn how to grow vegetables, ^CharacterName^?
Sure! Can we grow watermelons ^CharacterName^?
Eh… no, not really. But we can grow other veggies like carrots and parsley…
I don’t like parsley...
It’ll be very tasty in soups and stews, you’ll see.
If you say so…
^CharacterName^, let’s melt some snow!
Why?
So that we have water to drink and cook.
Oh, ok.
So, what do we need to do before we drink the water?
Hmm… boil it so that there are no germs?
Yes. And we also filter it to make sure it’s clean.
Hey ^CharacterName^, ever wondered how this works?
Yeah! Will you show me?
It’s very simple. You see, rainwater is collected in the barrel...
And if we put a water filter here, we will have some clean water!
Wow, that is really simple!
Remember to replace the filters often though, they get used up quickly.
Wanna learn something useful, ^CharacterName^?
Yeah!
Ok, then. Here’s how you make bandages, see?
I see.
Do you know why we use alcohol here?
Why?
We use it as a disinfectant.
A dis-what?
Disinfectant. It kills germs.
Oh, I understand.
Can you help me with something, ^CharacterName^?
Yes, what is it?
I’m making tobacco from herbs. We can use it to make cigarettes.
What for?
So that we can exchange them for food or some other things.
Like toys?
Well… yes, that too.
Yay!
I’ll teach you to make cigarettes, which we can later trade, okay?
Okay. But aren’t cigarettes bad for health?
They are, but some people like them. Now focus.
Okay... what should I do then?
First of all, grab some rolling paper and place tobacco on it, like this.
Now roll it up with your fingers after wetting the side of the paper.
Do you want to learn how to roll up smokes, ^CharacterName^?
Roll up smokes?
Make crude cigarettes.
Oh… Why would I want to learn that? Cigarettes smell bad.
They do… but we could get things we need in exchange for them.
Well… ok then.
Great! We just need some home-grown tobacco and some rolling paper…
^CharacterName^, let me show you how to make quality roll-ups.
Don’t we do them like normal cigarettes?
We do, but we use equal parts of real tobacco and homemade tobacco.
Why?
To save real tobacco. It’s difficult to get nowadays.
Why not just use homemade tobacco then?
Because the taste will be better if we mix the two.
Would you like to become a hunter, ^CharacterName^?
Sure I would! Will I get a rifle?
No… but I can teach you to set traps.
Wow, bear traps?
Eh… no. Traps for small animals.
Like rabbits?
Sort of. More like rats.
Ewww… why?
They’re pests. Also, we can trade them.
What's this?!
Can I touch this?
What's inside?
Wow, can I play here?
What an old fridge...
Is there ice cream inside?
Someone came to us!
Who's that?
I want to open the door!
Let me see who it is!
Let me talk with your adult friend there.
We can trade when you grow up.
^CharacterName^! I feel ill, help me...
^CharacterName^! My head hurts, help me...
I really don't feel well...
It hurts so much, can you make it stop ^CharacterName^?
It hurts! It really hurts...
Can you do something about the pain, ^CharacterName^?
^CharacterName^!
I'm hungry ^CharacterName^! Can I have something to eat?
Can I have something to eat, please?
I'm hungry ^CharacterName^! I want something to eat!
Don't cry ^CharacterName^! I'm fine now, see?
I have a headache can you make it go away ^CharacterName^?
It hurts so much, can you do something ^CharacterName^?
^CharacterName^ do you hear me? I'm hungry!
Please do something ^CharacterName^!
I can't stand this any more!
Poor thing!
Be a brave {mr|boy}{fr|girl} ^CharacterName^.
I'm coming ^CharacterName^!
Poor thing, why does it have to be you?
It's boring to play one game all the time.
Hmm... what else can I do for fun?
I've already played with this today...
I don't want to play this anymore today.
It's fun, but I'd rather do something else now.
I don't want to be here... can we go far away?
I miss my old room and my toys...
Why don't we have a TV here? It would be nice to watch something together.
I need a warm hug...
Once there were birds and dogs and cats, now only ugly rats!
Will I die? I don't want to die!
Bad people will come and hurt us, I know it! I just know it!
I'm scared, I'm so scared...
Why won't they stop? Why are they hurting us? We didn't do anything to them!
I'm glad you're back! What did you bring?
^CharacterName^, can I go with you next time? Please!
^CharacterName^! Did you have adventures? What did you find?
We got attacked while you were gone!
Why weren't you here to protect me?
Bandits attacked us during the night! Where were you?
^CharacterName^! I got hurt!
^CharacterName^! I'm bleeding!
Help me ^CharacterName^! I'm hurt!
^CharacterName^, are you alright?!
Did someone hurt you, ^CharacterName^?!
Start!
Go away, leave me alone.
I want to be alone now.
Just let me sit here.
What is it? What does it do?
What's that? Is it for fun?
I'm not supposed to touch it...
It looks kinda weird...
Whoa! What an old fridge!
A fridge! Is there food inside?
I wonder if there are spiders inside?
Is there candy inside?
Was there pirate treasure inside?
I wonder what was inside. Maybe toys, or candy...
Is it a treasure chest?
How do you open it? Do you need a magic word?
Is this supposed to be a bed? It looks awful.
I had my own bed, and it was a proper bed, not ugly like this one.
Wow! Is it for me?
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
This should be fun!
Brilliant! It works!
Hi, you must be ^CharacterName^, right?
They're all lying!
That's not true!
I want ^CharacterName^ back. I miss {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Why did ^CharacterName^ leave me alone?
Where's ^CharacterName^? I know {mr|he}{fr|she} must be somewhere!
Hey, ^CharacterName^!
^CharacterName^ I'm coming to you!
Yeees?
Whaaat?
^CharacterName^!
Wait ^CharacterName^!
Yes ^CharacterName^?
What is it ^CharacterName^?
^CharacterName^ why did those people hurt me?
Look ^CharacterName^, they hurt me. I did nothing wrong to them.
I saw ^CharacterName^ on TV! He's a famous chef!
Is ^CharacterName^ a wizard? He told me he can make moonshine! Can he make sunshine too?
Did you know that ^CharacterName^ can build anything? Maybe he'll build me a robot!
^CharacterName^ says he is a handyman. What does that mean?
^CharacterName^ said that she can steal for us from others. Is she allowed to do that?
^CharacterName^ can be very quiet, she can even run quietly!
I asked ^CharacterName^ what's the difference between a lawyer and a liar, but she didn't say.
I think that ^CharacterName^ doesn't care about us.
^CharacterName^ told me that he has never fought anyone. He hates violence.
^CharacterName^ says he doesn't smoke or drink, but everybody has to drink something, don't they?
^CharacterName^ says that his leg is weak, but his fist is strong.
^CharacterName^ is so strong! He can carry much more than anyone else.
Did you know that ^CharacterName^ was a firefighter? He is brave and strong!
^CharacterName^ doesn't smoke. He says that cigarettes are bad for your health.
Have you seen how fast ^CharacterName^ can run? Can I be a football player when I grow up?
I'm not scared when ^CharacterName^ is around. {mr|He}{fr|She} cares about us.
Everyone likes ^CharacterName^. She's kind and really cares about us.
I like ^CharacterName^ very much, {mr|he}{fr|she} is good to me.
Maybe ^CharacterName^ will teach me something. She is a teacher you know.
^CharacterName^ loves kids, so she looks after me.
^CharacterName^ was on TV. She says people know her and it helps her buy things cheaper.
Other people like ^CharacterName^ because she is from TV. They give her good deals!
^CharacterName^ has cold eyes. He is scary sometimes.
^CharacterName^ said that he knows how to use weapons. I want to know too!
It's cold! Can we have some fire?
Why is it so cold in here? Is our heater ok?
Hey! Hey ^CharacterName^! We caught a rat in our trap!
^CharacterName^, go check the trap! There is a rat trapped inside!
We have some really nice plants in the garden! What can we do with them?
^CharacterName^ are you going to pick those plants? They are so big!
^CharacterName^, I think you should check on the alcohol machine.
I think that the alcohol can go into bottles now.
It's not so bad in here.
This house is like a big playground!
It would be fun to play hide and seek with my friends here!
I always wanted to live in a big house, now I have a chance!
I wonder if there's hidden treasure in here somewhere.
Abandoned houses are often haunted, I wonder if this one is.
There's nothing fun to do here.
I wish I could play some board games with someone.
I wish my friends were here. I hope they're okay.
It's sad to play alone. I wish some other kids were here.
This house is so empty and full of holes...
I wish I had a pet to play with. Like a kitten, or a puppy.
I don't want bad people to hurt us, but they will. I know they will.
I'm really lonely, I miss my friends.
I don't feel safe here, I can hear people shooting nearby.
I wish I could close my eyes and just disappear, and be safe.
It's scary at night! There are shots and explosions and people screaming!
I'm worried about my friends. I don't want them to be killed by bombs!
I'm scared, I don't want to be here anymore!
I want to get away from here, it's the worst place in the world!
Why is this happening to me? I did nothing wrong!
Nobody loves me! They would take me away from here if they did!
Why doesn't someone come to save us? Why?
I hate the soldiers, I wish they were all dead!
I don't want to die.
I hate this war. I hate it.
I think I'll die tonight.
No... no... no... no...
What did I do wrong?
I'll be good, I promise...
Children have it hardest in war.
I need to be strong for ^CharacterName^.
{mr|He}{fr|She} should be in school, with other kids. Damn this war.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star, how I wonder what you are...
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe...
Itsy bitsy spider climbed up the waterspout...
No, you can't go play outside Mr Spider! It's dangerous there.
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, doctor, lawyer, Indian chief.
I miss playing with my friends.
I hate that school is closed. I don't see my friends anymore.
I'm not supposed to play outside because of the stupid soldiers!
It wouldn't be so bad if I had a pet to play with, but I don't.
Board games and comic books were fun. Too bad we don't have them here.
I don't want to be here ^CharacterName^... can we go far away?
I miss my old room ^CharacterName^... and my toys...
I need a hug ^CharacterName^...
I'm scared ^CharacterName^...
Can you play with me ^CharacterName^ ?
What are you doing ^CharacterName^?... you don't have time do you?
What a huge house...! So dark and gloomy.
Does anyone live here? Are they dead?
I'm not scared of this old house. Not at all.
Are there rats living here?
Why are there so many holes in here?
Where do I sleep?
Why can't we live in a normal house?
Is this our new home?
^CharacterName^ is unwell. In this state {mr|he}{fr|she} won't learn much...
^CharacterName^ doesn't feel well. I'll wait until {mr|he}{fr|she} gets better.
^CharacterName^ seems busy right now.
^CharacterName^ is doing something else now. Maybe I'll ask later.
^CharacterName^, come to me! I'll teach you something new.
Come ^CharacterName^, I'll show you something new!
What is it now? Where are you going?!
Kids are so impatient!
Right now? Okay I'm coming!
Coming!
Why did we stop?
What's wrong? I want to learn!
From now on I can do it, so you don't have to!
I've learned a new thing!
^CharacterName^?
Where are you going ^CharacterName^?
^CharacterName^?
Where are you going ^CharacterName^?
Poor thing...
Why do such things happen to children?
Enough chores for today.
I can do it later.
Give me a break, I'm tired.
Oh come on! I'm tired!
^CharacterName^!
^CharacterName^...
Where's ^CharacterName^? I haven't seen {mr|him}{fr|her} since yesterday...
^CharacterName^, are you home? Where are you?
I hope ^CharacterName^ is okay...
I'm worried about ^CharacterName^, why did {mr|he}{fr|she} have to go?
When will ^CharacterName^ be back? Why didn't {mr|he}{fr|she} stay with me?
I want ^CharacterName^ to be here already...
I wonder if ^CharacterName^ wants to be my friend.
Maybe ^CharacterName^ has some interesting stories to tell?
Will ^CharacterName^ stay with us for good?
Maybe I'll feel less lonely, now that ^CharacterName^ is around.
Hey! Where are you going ^CharacterName^?
Open the door, please!
Can we talk? Please answer me. We are waiting.
I have a child here! You can't just leave us.
I beg you, help us!
We have nowhere to go. Don't leave us!
Will you help us? You won't regret it!
Let's go {mr|big guy}{fr|dear}, we cannot give up hope.
We'll try elsewhere.
Thank you, we're very grateful!
You're very kind, thank you!
We just need to wait a minute dear.
They just need to discuss it. Don't worry dear, it'll be fine.
Have you got no heart? It's just a child!
Where else are we to go? Please, think it over.
(Talking)
(Looking after)
(Looked after)
I'm hungry...
My tummy is rumbling...
I want to eat!
Make me a sandwich!
Give me food! I'm very hungry!
Where is the food for me? I'm hungry!
I'm so hungry I could eat anything. Anything at all...
My tummy hurts, I must eat something...
My tummy is full.
It's nice to have a full tummy.
Is there a chance for dessert?
That'll do for now.
My tummy is still rumbling...
I wouldn't mind another helping...
I'm so full it almost hurts!
Quite a feast!
Look, I scratched my hand!
Look, there is blood...
My hand hurts...
I wish it didn't hurt so much.
It hurts bad! Really bad! Help me!
Please, make it stop hurting!
It hurts so much all the time, and it looks ugly...
Am I going to die?
I've got a runny nose.
I think I've caught a cold.
I've got a sore throat.
Is it flu?
I've got chills and sneeze all the time.
I'm really sick...
My head hurts so much, and I can't stop coughing.
My chest hurts a lot when I cough...
I'm not coughing anymore!
These pills are really helping! I should be well soon.
I feel a little bit better now.
It's helping. I should take more soon.
Can I sleep in a bed tonight?
I couldn't sleep well...
I like it when it's warm.
I hope it stays warm here.
My hands are cold!
I'm cold, can we turn up the heat?
Why is it so cold? I'm freezing!
I'm so cold, I want to sit by the fire!
I miss ^CharacterName^, I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} will be back soon...
Where is ^CharacterName^?
Is ^CharacterName^ dead?
Am I going to die too..?
Where's ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} should be back already...
What happened with ^CharacterName^?
Has anyone seen ^CharacterName^?
I wish ^CharacterName^ had stayed home!
{mr|He}{fr|She} is never coming back!
What happened to ^CharacterName^? Tell me!
Nobody tells me anything! Where's ^CharacterName^?
How could {mr|he}{fr|she} just disappear and leave us alone?!
^CharacterName^ won't tell me what happened at night.
There's something strange about ^CharacterName^ today.
^CharacterName^ is so silent today… I wonder what happened.
Why won't anyone tell me what happened at night?
I'm big, why is everyone treating me like a kid?!
^CharacterName^ is pale today, is {mr|he}{fr|she} sick?
I think ^CharacterName^ did something really bad.
^CharacterName^ is different today, what happened?
Something's wrong with ^CharacterName^, but I don't know what.
Something is troubling ^CharacterName^, I can tell.
I had a bad dream about ^CharacterName^ I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} is back.
I can never wait for ^CharacterName^ to come back.
^CharacterName^ won't tell me what happened at night.
I'm always worried about ^CharacterName^ when {mr|he}{fr|she} goes out at night.
I'm worried... something is different about ^CharacterName^ today.
I know something bad happened, but nobody tells me anything!
I overheard that ^CharacterName^ had a dangerous adventure!
^CharacterName^ said that we are a little bit safer now!
^CharacterName^ was in trouble during the night, I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to go out again!
^CharacterName^ should stay home tonight, it's scary outside.
I overheard ^CharacterName^ was in danger during the night! I want {mr|him}{fr|her} to stay home!
I don't want ^CharacterName^ to risk life for me, I want {mr|him}{fr|her} to be safe.
Soldiers are dangerous, but ^CharacterName^ is very brave!
^CharacterName^ won't let any soldier hurt us!
I heard ^CharacterName^ met a bad soldier! I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to get hurt!
I don't want ^CharacterName^ to meet soldiers again, they are scary!
The bad soldiers are everywhere now, nowhere is safe!
If the soldiers come looking for ^CharacterName^, they'll hurt us!
^CharacterName^ said it’s just a flesh wound.
^CharacterName^ showed me the scratches and said they will make an awesome scar!
I saw ^CharacterName^ bleeding...
I hope ^CharacterName^ will be okay soon.
Someone should really, really look after ^CharacterName^.
^CharacterName^ needs some bandages as soon as possible.
It must hurt ^CharacterName^ a lot!
Is ^CharacterName^ going to die..?
They have to do something about ^CharacterName^! {mr|He}{fr|She} is in pain all the time!
I saw ^CharacterName^ cry in pain! {mr|He}{fr|She} needs a doctor!
^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} will eat soon enough!
^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} is not hungry at all!
I heard ^CharacterName^’s tummy rumbling!
^CharacterName^ is getting really, really thin!
^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} is not hungry at all, but I don’t believe it…
^CharacterName^ should eat something, we all need to eat.
^CharacterName^ complains how hungry {mr|he}{fr|she} is.
^CharacterName^ is unhappy because {mr|he}{fr|she} is hungry.
^CharacterName^ is very weak, {mr|he}{fr|she} couldn’t even hold me!
^CharacterName^ is so thin! I can see {mr|his}{fr|her} bones now!
^CharacterName^ is back! ^CharacterName^ is back!
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ is back! I was told not to worry, but I did anyway!
I was really, really worried!
I was scared you weren't going to come back!
^CharacterName^ was away so long, I even cried!
I thought I'd never see ^CharacterName^ again...
^CharacterName^ is coughing a bit, but {mr|he}{fr|she} says it's nothing serious.
^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} is a little bit sick, but will be okay soon.
I heard that ^CharacterName^ is very sick. I don’t want {mr|him}{fr|her} to be sick.
^CharacterName^ wanted me to keep away from {mr|him}{fr|her}...
I don't think ^CharacterName^ is getting any better at all!
I saw ^CharacterName^ having really bad shivers! And {mr|he}{fr|she} is sweating a lot!
I don’t want ^CharacterName^ to die!
Can somebody help ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} looks really ill!
Is ^CharacterName^ going to die because of that sickness?
Can't we just take ^CharacterName^ to the hospital? {mr|He}{fr|She} doesn't look well!
Someone was trying to break into our house at night!
I woke up at night, when I heard people shouting and fighting. I was scared.
There were some bad people outside at night.
Will those bad people come back again?
I was scared of those people who came at night.
I don't want those bad people to come back.
Why did they attack us? Why won't they leave us alone?
I'm afraid of those burglars who came at night.
I don't feel safe here, I hope those bad men won't come back.
I was really scared of those people at night.
Some bad men came at night, but we were brave.
Bandits can’t hurt us here, our house is like a fortress.
Who were the bad people that came to us at night?
Why did those people try to rob us? We don't have much.
I hope those burglars don't come back...
I wish there were no thieves trying to rob us at night.
Why won't they leave us alone? Why?
This wouldn't happen in our old house.
I'm small, I can't fight big strong burglars.
If they come again, they'll hurt us.
If only we could kill them so that they don't come back!
We won't let the bandits beat us. We won't!
Bad people hurt us! Why?
What if those bad men come back? What then?
Can we do something more to stop those men from hurting us?
I'm scared those bad people will come back and hurt us even more!
I want those bad people to stop hurting us, but what can I do?
It's horrible, those bad people can hurt us whenever they like!
I wish we could kill all those bad people!
I hate those burglars, I want them all to die!
I can't sleep at night...
I'm afraid to fall asleep...
I can't sleep, I'm afraid a bomb will hit our home.
People are shooting at night... what if they come to kill us?
^CharacterName^ can't sleep at night. {mr|He}{fr|She} looks pale.
^CharacterName^ just rolls from one side to another all night. {mr|He}{fr|She} can't sleep.
Why did ^CharacterName^ leave us? Where did {mr|he}{fr|she} go?
^CharacterName^ will be back soon, right? Right?
Why did ^CharacterName^ leave us? I don't understand...
I hate ^CharacterName^! Why did {mr|he}{fr|she} leave us alone?
^CharacterName^ shouldn't drink alcohol...
I don't like it when ^CharacterName^ drinks alcohol!
I hate it when ^CharacterName^ drinks!
Why does {mr|he}{fr|she} have to drink?
^CharacterName^ took all we had and ran away! How could {mr|he}{fr|she}?
I thought ^CharacterName^ was our friend, but {mr|he}{fr|she} is nothing more than a dirty thief!
^CharacterName^ betrayed us, and stole from us. I hate {mr|him}{fr|her}!
How could ^CharacterName^ steal from us? I hate {mr|him}{fr|her}!
I overheard an argument last night. ^CharacterName^ was really mean...
Someone was shouting really loudly last night. I wonder what happened.
Why did ^CharacterName^ scream so much yesterday?
Why was ^CharacterName^ so mean? It makes no sense at all!
Why did ^CharacterName^ do it? Why?!
How could ^CharacterName^ leave me like that?!
^CharacterName^ killed {mr|himself}{fr|herself}... Will I die too?
I hate ^CharacterName^ for leaving me like that! I hate {mr|him}{fr|her}!
^CharacterName^ was sad and cried, and it made me sad too...
I wish ^CharacterName^ wouldn’t cry, but I don't know what to do.
When I hear ^CharacterName^ cry, I feel like crying too.
^CharacterName^ cried all night. It must be really bad. Are we going to die?
Everybody's so silent today...
^CharacterName^ has a black eye. What happened at night?
How could ^CharacterName^ do that?!
^CharacterName^ is a bully!
^CharacterName^ ran away from us, but I think {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll be back.
We don't need ^CharacterName^ anyway, do we?
Where did ^CharacterName^ go?
^CharacterName^ left us because we were mean to {mr|him}{fr|her}.
^CharacterName^ left us, but how can {mr|he}{fr|she} live alone?
We should've been nicer to ^CharacterName^.
^CharacterName^ is upset, I hope it's not my fault!
Maybe if I play with ^CharacterName^, it will cheer {mr|him}{fr|her} up!
^CharacterName^ is really upset, I wonder why...
I don't want ^CharacterName^ to be angry...
Does ^CharacterName^ hate us?
^CharacterName^ looks very angry, I hope it's not my fault.
Everyone around here is hungry, but I’m sure we will eat soon!
We're all hungry... a pizza would be great!
Everyone is hungry, but we have nothing to eat...
Can we get something to eat now, please?
It's sad when everyone is hungry...
We have to go shopping! We need food!
I don't understand why we have nothing to eat...
I don't want anybody to be hungry anymore!
Our tummies are rumbling, we must eat something... but what?
Everybody is hungry and I don't know what to do...
The ancient warriors were proud of their scars, we should be proud too.
Everyone is bruised, but it's nothing, we are strong.
Everyone around here is hurt...
I wish we had something to make the pain go away.
I don't want anyone to suffer, but what can I do?
If only I could do something to help everyone get better.
Why do people hurt each other? Why can't they stop? Why?
This is bad! We must all go to see a doctor!
We must all go to the hospital!
Why do bad people hurt us? We're not bothering anyone!
We won't give in to the sickness, we'll be strong!
At school there was a time when everyone was sick at the same time!
Everyone around here is sick...
Everybody is so pale...
Why is everybody sick? Can't we do something?
Has everyone got the flu?
This sickness is serious, we need help!
We really need a doctor to come to see us!
We need pills or something, but where can we get them?
I don't want anyone to die! I don’t want to!
^CharacterName^ helped some people who were in trouble. Maybe they'll be our friends?
If we help each other out like last night, the soldiers can't win!
^CharacterName^ brought some fine stuff. I wonder how {mr|he}{fr|she} got it?
^CharacterName^ didn't talk much about last night, but {mr|he}{fr|she} brought some nice things.
^CharacterName^ says we should be kind to other people.
^CharacterName^ said we can't help everyone, but at least we have to try.
The priest said that every kind deed brings us closer to heaven.
Some hungry man asked ^CharacterName^ for food, but we are hungry too.
We're not the only hungry people in the city...
I wish we had more food...
^CharacterName^ freed some kidnapped women! {mr|He}{fr|She}'s a hero!
^CharacterName^ is very brave!
If I'm ever kidnapped, ^CharacterName^ will save me.
No one is as brave as ^CharacterName^!
Fighting evil men and rescuing those in need is what ^CharacterName^ does!
The snipers kill many people, but they couldn't kill ^CharacterName^!
Now the snipers will be afraid to come to that construction site.
I wonder where those old people get all the good things.
The kind old people were generous to ^CharacterName^.
It's nice that people share what they have with us.
^CharacterName^ looks sad, despite {mr|him}{fr|her} bringing so much stuff.
I think ^CharacterName^ isn't telling me the whole truth...
^CharcterName^ wouldn't have lied to me, would {mr|he}{fr|she}?
^CharacterName^ visited those friendly old people again. They're fine!
^CharacterName^ said those nice old people who shared with us are in heaven.
Those old people won't share with us anymore... they're gone.
^CharacterName^ looks sad. I think {mr|he}{fr|she} liked those old people.
Something ^CharacterName^ saw made {mr|him}{fr|her} sad, but I don't know what it was.
I wonder what made ^CharacterName^ so sad.
I don't know why ^CharacterName^ won't tell me what {mr|he}{fr|she} saw...
Something really bad must've happened last night. ^CharacterName^ looked really pale.
I heard that ^CharacterName^ saw a soldier hurting someone.
The soldiers are evil and hurt people! I hope they all die!
^CharacterName^ is a hero!
The soldiers can't hurt anyone when ^CharacterName^ is around!
The soldiers better run when they see ^CharacterName^!
^CharacterName^ told me {mr|he}{fr|she} saw a man being shot by a sniper.
I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to risk going there again.
That Sniper Junction is really dangerous.
I don't want ^CharacterName^ to get shot by a sniper!
^CharacterName^ shouldn't go to that dangerous place again!
Let's just stay here, let's not take risks.
^CharacterName^ saved a man who was shot by a sniper.
That man was lucky ^CharacterName^ was there.
I hate snipers! I'm glad ^CharacterName^ saved that man.
It's too dangerous to go to that place!
I'm scared ^CharacterName^ might not come back next time...
What if some sniper kills ^CharacterName^? What then?
^CharacterName^ brought some supplies from the hospital.
The hospital still helps people like us. That's good!
^CharacterName^ is sad because of all the wounded people {mr|he}{fr|she} saw.
The hospital is a depressing place.
Why is ^CharacterName^ sad? What happened at the hospital?
What troubles ^CharacterName^?
^CharacterName^ shared some of our stuff with the doctor at the hospital.
Now that doctor can help more people.
I don't know if it was a good idea to give away our things...
What if someone gets ill or hurt?
Don't they have enough stuff at the hospital? Do they need our stuff too?
Aren't we supposed to get help from the hospital, rather than the other way around?
I don't want ^CharacterName^ to die. I wish I could help {mr|him}{fr|her} get better, but what can I do?
Why doesn't someone help ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} needs to go to see a doctor!
^CharacterName^ is coughing all the time, {mr|he}{fr|she} will make us all sick too!
If ^CharacterName^ dies, I'll never forgive {mr|him}{fr|her}!
^CharacterName^ is sick. I think {mr|he}{fr|she} should go to see the doctor.
^CharacterName^ is coughing a lot, I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} gets better soon.
^CharacterName^ is very, very ill. I'm scared. Why isn't the doctor coming?!
I'm so worried about my little ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} is very ill, and in these conditions... No, it’s best not to even think about it.
I feel really sick... Am I dying? I don't want to die...
Am I getting any better? I don't think I am...
I don't wanna be sick anymore, why can't I get better?! Why can't I go to see the doctor?!
I don't want to lie in bed, I don't want to be sick! Why doesn't someone help me?!
I don't feel well... I think I should go to see the doctor...
I'm sick. I don't wanna be sick. Can I have some pills or something?
I think ^CharacterName^ robbed someone, but {mr|he}{fr|she} won't tell me.
Nobody tells me anything! I asked ^CharacterName^ where {mr|he}{fr|she} got all those things, but {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't say.
^CharacterName^ was in a garage, and brought home some interesting things!
I'm worried ^CharacterName^ lied to me about where {mr|he}{fr|she} got all those things, but why would {mr|he}{fr|she}?
^CharacterName^ said some old people gave {mr|him}{fr|her} some things to help us, but I don't believe {mr|him}{fr|her}.
^CharacterName^ visited some nice people, and they gave {mr|him}{fr|her} some of their things. {mr|He}{fr|She} is sad because {mr|he}{fr|she} had nothing to give them to thank them.
Everyone in the city is hungry... It's so sad...
How could ^CharacterName^ give away our food like that?! That was stupid!
^CharacterName^ has a good heart and gave some food to a hungry, homeless man.
I'm afraid of hungry, homeless people. They might eat you if you're not careful.
^CharacterName^ met some dirty beggar, who was very rude to {mr|him}{fr|her} and tried to steal some food! We gotta watch out.
^CharacterName^ met some hungry beggar, but {mr|he}{fr|she} could not help him.
Damn those soldiers! They think they can do whatever they want! Fucking criminals!
I saw a soldier abusing a girl... We had better avoid those pigs.
What happened to that girl was terrible but that soldier would have hurt me worse, had I interfered.
What happened to that girl happens every day in wartime. If I'd tried to help her, that soldier would've killed me.
I feel sorry for that girl... but what was I supposed to do?
I saw a soldier abusing some poor girl. I'm just glad it wasn't anyone I know.
That soldier was so cruel to that girl... And I was too powerless to stop him.
That pig took advantage of a defenseless girl but I couldn't stop him... It would've put us all in danger if I had.
I couldn't help that girl. I couldn't do anything. I felt so powerless.
What that soldier did to that poor girl... how can anyone be so cruel? If only I was strong enough to save her...
There was nothing ^CharacterName^ could do to save that girl.
It's so sad that ^CharacterName^ couldn't save that girl.
What that soldier did to that poor girl... how can anyone be so cruel? If only ^CharacterName^ had helped her...
Poor girl... I can't stop thinking about what happened to her...
I pity that girl... but that soldier would have done much worse to ^CharacterName^, had {mr|he}{fr|she} interfered.
Poor girl... We should avoid those cruel military scumbags.
^CharacterName^ couldn't risk helping that girl, he would've put us all in danger.
Where were that girl's friends? Or family? ^CharacterName^ wasn't obliged to save her.
That soldier was so cruel to that girl... And ^CharacterName^ was too powerless to stop him.
The military are so cruel... we have to make sure we're able to defend ourselves against them.
Poor, defenseless girl, abused by that monster... but if ^CharacterName^ had tried to stop him, we could have all been in danger.
That unfortunate girl... I can't imagine something like that happen to my sister, daughter, or friend.
I can understand why ^CharacterName^ did not help that girl. It was too dangerous.
What could have ^CharacterName^ done against that soldier? They're trained killers!
^CharacterName^ saw something horrible happen last night, but I don't know what it was.
I'm angry at ^CharacterName^! Something's wrong but {mr|he}{fr|she} won't share with me what it is...
I know something really bad happened last night, but ^CharacterName^ won't tell me what it was.
Some poor lady was in trouble and ^CharacterName^ came to her aid, but it was really dangerous. {mr|He}{fr|She} could've died!
An evil soldier wanted to hurt some poor girl, but ^CharacterName^ saved her! I hope that soldier is dead!
^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} saved some girl, but {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't tell me all the details even though I asked.
Those snipers are everywhere... I don't want ^CharacterName^ to go out again! I want {mr|him}{fr|her} to be safe!
I hope someone kills that sniper! How dare he shoot at ^CharacterName^?!
A sniper tried to kill ^CharacterName^! I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to go back there again...
^CharacterName^ saved that man risking {mr|his}{fr|her} life. What if {mr|he}{fr|she}'d been killed? What then?
That man was lucky ^CharacterName^ was there to save him! ^CharacterName^ is the best!
^CharacterName^ told me how brave {mr|he}{fr|she} was last night! {mr|He}{fr|She} saved a man shot by a sniper!
^CharacterName^ helped some people in the hospital, but who will help us now?
How can ^CharacterName^ give away our things when we need them? I don't understand!
^CharacterName^ gave some things to a doctor at the hospital, so that he could save more people who are sick or hurt.
^CharacterName^ says a doctor gave {mr|him}{fr|her} some supplies, but I think {mr|he}{fr|she} might have stolen them...
I think ^CharacterName^ might have stolen some things from the hospital but I don't care, as long as {mr|he}{fr|she}'s here with me.
^CharacterName^ got some help from the hospital, but became sad when {mr|he}{fr|she} saw all those poor and hurt people there.
Why are there so many bandits in the city? ^CharacterName^ got rid of some of them, but how many more are left? Will they ever go away?
No one can beat ^CharacterName^! {mr|He}{fr|She} dealt with a bunch of bandits all by {mr|himself}{fr|herself}. I wish {mr|he}{fr|she} would kill all the bandits and evil soldiers!
^CharacterName^ is a true hero! {mr|He}{fr|She} saved some ladies from some bad men, just like in the stories!
Some evil soldiers were shooting at people and ^CharacterName^ stopped them, but I just know that more soldiers will come.
^CharacterName^ killed some evil snipers! They got what they deserved! I wish {mr|he}{fr|she} could kill them all!
^CharacterName^ met some bad soldiers, but {mr|he}{fr|she} was not afraid and chased them away! {mr|He}{fr|She} says they won't come back.
Can I have something to eat? Please, I'm hungry...
Why is there nothing to eat? Can't we go out and get something?
I want to eat! Why doesn’t anyone give me something to eat?!
If no one gives me anything to eat, I'm gonna get angry! You'll see!
I'm hungry. I miss hamburgers. And ice cream. And chocolate!
Can I have a sandwich or something? I'll be good, I promise...
How come ^CharacterName^ is always hungry?
^CharacterName^ is sad because {mr|he}{fr|she} has nothing to eat.
It's unfair that other people have food when ^CharacterName^ is hungry!
^CharacterName^ must be really angry that there is no food for {mr|him}{fr|her}. I would be!
^CharacterName^ says {mr|he}{fr|she}'s very hungry. Can't {mr|he}{fr|she} go shopping or something?
I heard ^CharacterName^'s tummy rumbling loudly. I think {mr|he}{fr|she} should eat something.
I've never been hungry for so long...
I'm so hungry it hurts...
Give me something to eat! I'm hungry!
If you don't give me something to eat, I'll hate you!
I'm so hungry I'd even eat some dull porridge...
My tummy hurts, I need to eat something...
You can see that ^CharacterName^'s tummy hurts...
If {mr|he}{fr|she} doesn't eat something, ^CharacterName^ will have problems with {mr|his}{fr|her} tummy.
Maybe some people who have food should share with us? It's not fair if they don't!
^CharacterName^ says {mr|he}{fr|she}'s very hungry. Why can't we just go buy some food or something?
^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} is so hungry {mr|he}{fr|she} could eat a horse. But there are no horses here. Not anymore.
I think ^CharacterName^ should eat something. You have to eat to be healthy.
^CharacterName^ needs to eat, just look at the poor kid...
I saw a homeless dog once. It was so thin you could see its ribs sticking out. I can see mine now...
People can die if they don't eat for a long time. Will I die too?
I don't believe that there's nothing to eat!
I want to eat! I want to eat now! My tummy hurts!
Why does nobody care that I'm hungry? Nobody loves me...
I haven't had anything to eat for a long time, but no one really cares. No one.
If you look at ^CharacterName^ you can see {mr|his}{fr|her} ribs sticking out...
Will ^CharacterName^ die? {mr|He}{fr|She} looks really bad...
I don't want ^CharacterName^ to die! I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to die!
We have to get ^CharacterName^ something to eat. We have to!
I thought I heard a big dog growling last night and it frightened me, but it was only ^CharacterName^'s tummy. {mr|He}{fr|She} should have something to eat.
^CharacterName^ looks really, really weak. The teachers say that you have to eat meat to be strong. Do we have any?
I have to get food for ^CharacterName^ at all costs, I can't let this child starve.
I don't want ^CharacterName^ to die! We need a doctor!
^CharacterName^ is hurt, what can we do? Let's find some band-aids, or a doctor, or... I... I don't know!
I hate those people who hurt ^CharacterName^! I hate them!
When I grow up, I'll hurt those people who hurt ^CharacterName^.
^CharacterName^ is badly hurt. I wanted to see how badly, but {mr|he}{fr|she} wouldn't let me see.
^CharacterName^ should get a medal. I heard that soldiers get special medals if they fight and get hurt.
^CharacterName^ is very badly hurt. I can't stop crying. I'm scared. I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to die!
How evil do you have to be to hurt a child?! How could they?! Poor little ^CharacterName^.
It hurts, it hurts so much, why does it hurt so much?
Can you make it not hurt anymore please? Please...
When I am older, I'll find the people who hurt me and kill them!
When I grow up, I'll be big and strong, and I'll buy a gun, and I won't let anyone hurt me!
My wound hurts. It hurts the most when I move or when I touch it, but it even hurts when I don't move. I don't want it to hurt.
I am hurt. If I were a soldier, I would get a medal. They get medals when they get hurt.
Don't leave me alone at night, I'm scared that those bad people will come again... please...
I'm scared... I'm scared... I'm scared...
If I were a soldier, I would kill all the bad people! All of them!
Those bad people deserve to die! I hope the snipers kill them!
I'm scared! I don't want those bad people to come here again. Can you stop them from coming here again?
Some bad people came here last night! They came to steal our things and hurt us! Why did they do that?
Poor ^CharacterName^, what have they done to {mr|him}{fr|her}?
If I had stayed with ^CharacterName^, maybe {mr|he}{fr|she} wouldn't have got hurt...
^CharacterName^ is dead isn't {mr|he}{fr|she}? Tell me...
No it's not true, it can't be true! ^CharacterName^ can't be dead!
No, I don't believe it! It's a lie! ^CharacterName^ can't be dead!
Why is ^CharacterName^ dead?! Why not the people who killed {mr|him}{fr|her}! They should be dead! I want them dead!
I haven't seen ^CharacterName^ today. Where did {mr|he}{fr|she} go? Will {mr|he}{fr|she} come back?
^CharacterName^ did not come back this morning. What happened? Is {mr|he}{fr|she} okay?
I hate everyone!!! I want my ^CharacterName^!
How could ^CharacterName^ die? How? It's not fair...
No... ^CharacterName^... No...
Why did ^CharacterName^ have to die? I hate {mr|him}{fr|her}!
^CharacterName^ can't be dead! What will we do without {mr|him}{fr|her}?
Something horrible happened last night. Yesterday ^CharacterName^ wasn't feeling well, and now... now {mr|he}{fr|she}'s dead.
Why did ^CharacterName^ have to die? I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to be dead!
Why did ^CharacterName^ die? Why?!
Why did those bad men kill ^CharacterName^? Why? {mr|He}{fr|She} didn’t do anything to them...
Those evil people will come back and kill us like they killed ^CharacterName^. I just know it.
I hate those people who killed ^CharacterName^! I hate them!
If I could make those evil people who killed ^CharacterName^ die, I would!
Some bad people came here last night and killed ^CharacterName^! It's unfair! Why did they do that?! Why?!
Last night bandits came and killed ^CharacterName^. I couldn't save {mr|him}{fr|her}. When I grow up, I'll become a dark avenger and avenge {mr|him}{fr|her}!
I hate everyone!!! I want my ^CharacterName^!
It's so cold... so cold... ^CharacterName^ was so cold, {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't wake up...
Will I freeze like ^CharacterName^? Does it hurt to die like that?
I don't want to fall asleep and not wake up like ^CharacterName^, I want it to be warm!
I hate the cold! It took ^CharacterName^, and it wants to take us too! We can't let it!
It was very cold last night and ^CharacterName^ didn't wake up in the morning. Why can't it be warm? If it was warm, {mr|he}{fr|she} would be okay!
It's so cold that if you go to sleep you might not wake up, like ^CharacterName^. I don't want to end up cold and pale like {mr|him}{fr|her}. I don't want to!
I hate winter! I hate it! I want my ^CharacterName^ back!
Why did ^CharacterName^ go out during the day? {mr|He}{fr|She} knew how dangerous it was!
We mustn't go out during the day... we mustn't go out during the day... we mustn't...
If ^CharacterName^ didn't go with those people, {mr|he}{fr|she}'d still be with us. I hate them!
I hate this war! I hate it! Why can't we go out and be safe?! It's not fair, not fair...
You're not supposed to leave home during the day because it's dangerous, but ^CharacterName^ did and {mr|he}{fr|she} hasn't come back!
^CharacterName^ went to help our neighbors, but didn't come back. Did something bad happen to {mr|him}{fr|her}?
Don't lie to me! ^CharacterName^ will be back soon, we just have to wait!
I was so worried... I don't want ^CharacterName^ to leave during the day again...
We're not supposed to go out during the day, I was scared ^CharacterName^ wouldn't come back...
Why did ^CharacterName^ go out during the day?! {mr|He}{fr|She} could've got hurt or killed!
I'm angry that ^CharacterName^ left when the sun was still up! It was dangerous!
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ came back, I missed {mr|him}{fr|her}!
^CharacterName^ said that it's dangerous outside and I was worried when {mr|he}{fr|she} was leaving. I'm happy {mr|he}{fr|she} is back!
We're really, really sick... I hope someone helps us...
This illness is horrible... we need help...
I hate being sick! I feel terrible and I'm so weak...
A doctor... we need to go to see a doctor...
We are sick. A doctor should come and help us!
Why doesn't someone help us? We need some pills or something! Someone should go to a pharmacy!
I'm worried, I don't want the grown-ups to be sick... what will I do if they don't get better?
If the grown-ups don't get better how can they protect me?
The grown-ups must get better. They must!
Can't the grown-ups take some pills or something? They can't be sick all the time!
The others are sick, so it's up to me to be strong! They need my help.
The priest says that if you pray really hard, it will help. I'll pray for the others to get better soon!
We need something to eat, I think anything will do...
How come no one is going to get food when we're so hungry?
There must be something to eat somewhere! Can't we go and get it?!
If I was a wolf or a tiger, I could eat the soldiers! It’s too bad I'm not...
Everyone is hungry, we should go get some food. Pizza would be great!
We all need a big dinner, like during the holidays! We would always get stuffed. I miss that.
The grown-ups complain about how hungry they are. I'd like to help them, but there's nothing I can do...
Why is it so hard to get food? What happened to all the shops? It's all the soldiers' fault, isn't it?
It makes me angry that we can't get anything to eat because of the stupid soldiers!
I hope the soldiers are hungry too! I hope they have nothing to eat either and will go away soon!
The adults complain that they are hungry... If I was like Allan Quatermain, I could hunt wild animals and we could eat them!
I wish we had the magical horn of plenty. No one would go hungry then! But where could we find it?
If only we could fly out of the city... We'd never be hungry again! It’s too bad we can't...
The pain in my tummy is really bad... I have to eat something... anything...
If I was bigger and stronger, I would get food for all of us. I hate that I'm so small!
We could take some guns or axes or clubs and take food from someone else, couldn't we?
I'm so hungry I could cry, but we have no food. Someone should share with us, why don't they?
I heard somewhere that hungry, shipwrecked people sometimes eat each other! Yuck, that's gross! I don't want to eat anyone! And I hope no one will eat me, I don't want to be eaten!
I can't believe that there's not enough food for everyone, how's it possible?
Is there really so little food left? What happened to all the supermarkets and restaurants?
Wolves kill to get food, maybe we should do the same?
We must get something to eat! If you don't eat at all you will die!
My friend once said that hungry, shipwrecked people sometimes eat each other! Yuck, that's so gross! I don't think anyone would want to eat me, would they?
If I had a magic lamp with a genie inside, I'd wish for us to have lots of food!
Why can't I get anything to eat? I was good...
Everyone is very hungry... it's so weird, why isn't there enough food?
I'm hungry! If I don't get something to eat, I'll get angry!
There must be something to eat somewhere, you just have to try harder to get it!
I'd love some burgers! We should all go to a burger house! Why don't we?
Last time I was this hungry was when there was only disgusting porridge to eat, and I didn't eat it, and I didn't get anything else for a whole day as punishment.
Why is everyone hungry? Is there really no food left?
I remember seeing a hungry, homeless dog once. It had such sad eyes... I don't want anyone to have such sad eyes.
I don't understand why the grown-ups can’t get more food. It shouldn't be that hard!
One of my teachers said if you really want something from life, you can have it. But it was a lie. If it were true, we would have a lot of food.
If you are hungry, why don't you order some food? I know phones don't work, but you could go and order some takeaway.
The priest says that God gave food to some hungry people in the desert, so he will give us food if we pray to him, right?
We are hurt, we should be in hospital...
Why doesn't anyone protect us? Where are the police? Don't they know that we're helpless?
I want the people who hurt us dead! If I could, I'd kill them all!
I hope someone kills the people who hurt us! I hate them!
Why do bad people hurt us?! What did we do to them? I know I didn't do anything!
Why are there so many bad people around? Why don't the police put them in jail? We should tell the police about the bad people that hurt us.
If I wasn't so small I wouldn't let anyone hurt us...
If only a superhero would come to protect us from the criminals...
I hate people who hurt others! I hope they burn in hell!
People who hurt others don't deserve to live! I hope the bombs kill them!
When I am big and strong I will punish people who hurt you! They'll get what they deserve!
If I was a superhero I wouldn't let anyone hurt you! I'll become a superhero when I grow up, just wait and see!
^CharacterName^ did something horrible. But I don’t know what it was.
There was blood on ^CharacterName^'s hands when {mr|he}{fr|she} came home...
I hate this war! It made ^CharacterName^ do something really bad.
I hate it when ^CharacterName^ goes out at night, I wish {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't have to! Bad things happen out there!
I know something really bad must've happened to ^CharacterName^. {mr|He}{fr|She} doesn't look well. Just look at {mr|him}{fr|her}!
No one will tell me what happened last night to ^CharacterName^. They should tell me, I'm not a kid anymore!
A nice man came to us and gave us some pills. Was he a doctor?
Some man came to us. He seemed nice, but I think he was a drug dealer.
A man was shot and ^CharacterName^ went to save him! {mr|He}{fr|She}'s a hero!
A man came to us and he said his brother was shot and he needed help. But I think it was a trap.
I'm not supposed to be alone for long, so no one went with the man who asked us for help.
^CharacterName^ went to visit those nice neighbors who gave us vegetables. Maybe this time they will give us fruit or candy?
Those nice neighbors came to us again. I was hoping they brought us some fruit or candy, but they didn't.
Those nice neighbors who brought us vegetables came again, and asked for some help, but ^CharacterName^ couldn't leave me here alone.
That nice lady who visited us before asked ^CharacterName^ for help with something, and {mr|he}{fr|she} went with her.
That nice lady who visited us before asked ^CharacterName^ for help with something, but {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't go with her.
The nice lady came to us but there was no grown-up at home and she didn't say what she wanted.
Some kids came to visit us! We gave them some pills for their mom. I wonder if I can play with them the next time they come.
Some kids came to visit us. They looked really sad, I hope they are okay.
Some kids came to us asking for some pills for their mom, but we didn't have any. I hope their mom gets better.
Those kids came again, but they didn't want to play, they asked for food. We gave them some.
Those kids came again, but they didn't want to play, they asked for food. We didn't give them any.
Those kids came again, but they didn't want to play, they asked for food. We had no food to give them.
Those kids came again, crying for help! ^CharacterName^ went to take their mom to hospital.
Those kids came again crying for help, but no one went to help them. I would go, but I'm too small.
Those kids came again crying for help, but there was no grown-up at home apart from ^CharacterName^, and {mr|he}{fr|she} had to stay with me.
^CharacterName^ went to help some people from a house that was hit by a bomb. {mr|He}{fr|She} has a good heart.
A bomb hit a house in our neighborhood. I hope one doesn't hit ours too.
Some lady came to us to ask for help, but I'm too small, and someone has to stay with me.
A pretty lady came to us and gave us some beautiful earrings!
A pretty lady came to us to say 'thank you' for helping her dad. It was very nice of her.
^CharacterName^ went to help our neighbor. I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} brings some good things. Maybe even chocolate?
If ^CharacterName^ went with our neighbor, maybe he would give us some good things. Maybe even chocolate...
^CharacterName^ went to the hospital for some medicine. {mr|He}{fr|She} says it will help us a lot.
No one went with our neighbor to the hospital because he isn't a good man.
Two rebels came and gave us some food! Maybe they're not that bad after all?
Those rebel soldiers were really scary, but they didn't hurt us.
A lady came to us. She looked really worried so ^CharacterName^ went with her to help her solve her problem.
A lady came to us. She looked really worried, but no one did anything to help. I wonder why?
A lady in distress came, but I didn't want to stay alone and ^CharacterName^ didn't go with her.
The same lady as before came, and this time she looked really, really scared, so ^CharacterName^ went with her to make her feel safe.
The same lady as before came, and this time she looked really, really scared, but we were scared too, and we didn't go to help her.
The same lady as before came, and this time she looked really, really scared, but ^CharacterName^ didn't want to leave me here alone.
^CharacterName^... No... No...
Why, ^CharacterName^... Why...?
I hate ^CharacterName^ for leaving me! I hate {mr|him}{fr|her}!
I don't believe ^CharacterName^ killed {mr|himself}{fr|herself}! It's a lie! Someone must've killed {mr|him}{fr|her}!
No! It's horrible! ^CharacterName^ killed {mr|himself}{fr|herself}! Why did {mr|he}{fr|she} do that?
^CharacterName^ can't be dead! {mr|He}{fr|She} can't!
That's impossible... ^CharacterName^ wouldn't run away with all our things, would {mr|he}{fr|she}?
I don't believe ^CharacterName^ wanted to steal our things, someone must've made {mr|him}{fr|her} to do it!
I hate ^CharacterName^! I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} gets caught by soldiers!
I hope someone hurts ^CharacterName^! Why did {mr|he}{fr|she} steal from us?!
^CharacterName^ ran away with all our things! I didn't know {mr|he}{fr|she} was a thief! I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} dies!
How could ^CharacterName^ steal all of our things? I thought {mr|he}{fr|she} was our friend!
^CharacterName^ wouldn’t have left us, {mr|he}{fr|she} must've been kidnapped!
Why did ^CharacterName^ leave us? I don't understand...
^CharacterName^ shouldn't have left us like that. I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} regrets it!
^CharacterName^ is a stupid coward. {mr|He}{fr|She} was afraid to stay here with us.
I'm sure ^CharacterName^ left us to bring some help. We just have to wait.
I believe ^CharacterName^ will come back to us. {mr|He}{fr|She} surely will.
Poor ^CharacterName^... {mr|He}{fr|She} couldn't stand staying here any longer.
If no one shared anything with me, I'd run away like ^CharacterName^!
We were really selfish and stupid, and we made ^CharacterName^ run away.
Where is ^CharacterName^? {mr|He}{fr|She} should be here to help us fight the bandits if they come at night!
I think ^CharacterName^ ran away, because everyone was mean to {mr|him}{fr|her}.
You didn't share with ^CharacterName^, and look what you did! {mr|He}{fr|She} ran away!
No one wants to share with ^CharacterName^, that's really mean...
^CharacterName^ said {mr|he}{fr|she} will leave us if we don't treat {mr|him}{fr|her} better.
I would be angry just like ^CharacterName^ if people were so mean to me.
We shouldn't make ^CharacterName^ angry. I read about a superhero who becomes very dangerous when he gets angry.
^CharacterName^ is angry, because everyone is mean to {mr|him}{fr|her}.
No one likes to be bullied! Why is everyone mean to ^CharacterName^?
I cried myself to sleep, but no one came to hug me...
I don't want to cry, but I just can't help it...
I hate crying, but sometimes I just can't help it.
I'm really unhappy and I don't know what to do and I hate it and tears just keep flowing, even though I try to hold them back.
Last night I was really scared of the noises outside... I cried and I couldn't sleep.
I couldn't sleep, something was under my bed, and I was so scared! I cried, but no one came to help me...
My little ^CharacterName^ woke up crying and I couldn't calm {mr|him}{fr|her} down. It was heart-breaking and I felt so helpless... I just hope {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll be able to sleep calmly when all this is over.
The grown-ups were arguing last night... I think it may be my fault...
I don't want the grown-ups to argue, I'm scared when they scream and shout at each other...
I hate it when the grown-ups argue! Why can't they be nice to each other?
Can't the grown-ups see it's stupid to argue when we have so many other problems?
The adults were arguing at night. They were shouting and I couldn't sleep. I hope they weren't angry because of me.
I don't like it when the adults argue and shout. I'm always worried they are angry because of me.
^CharacterName^ acted like a bully last night... I was scared {mr|he}{fr|she} would hit me too.
I tried to stop ^CharacterName^ from being a bully, but {mr|he}{fr|she} wouldn't listen...
The grown-ups should be fighting the bandits, not each other! Can't they see it?
Fighting each other is stupid, when soldiers and bandits want to kill us!
The adults got into a fight last night, I couldn't stop them, I was so scared!
Something was wrong last night, the adults were shouting angrily so I covered my head with a blanket. I don't know what happened, I just hope it wasn't my fault.
Does ^CharacterName^ have to drink alcohol? I'm scared of {mr|him}{fr|her} when {mr|he}{fr|she} does...
I don't want ^CharacterName^ to drink alcohol... It makes {mr|him}{fr|her} act weird...
Drinking alcohol is bad! Why does ^CharacterName^ drink? I hate it when {mr|he}{fr|she} does!
I wish ^CharacterName^ didn't drink! It's stupid! We could sell alcohol and buy food instead!
^CharacterName^ drank alcohol last night, {mr|he}{fr|she} was shouting, and I was scared {mr|he}{fr|she} would hurt me, so I hid in a wardrobe.
Alcohol made ^CharacterName^ act very weird last night. I did not want {mr|him}{fr|her} to see me, so I hid and waited until {mr|he}{fr|she} went to sleep.
I thought everyone had forgotten about me. ^CharacterName^ didn't, but I'm still sad...
^CharacterName^ talked to me last night and helped me, but I still feel unloved...
How could everyone forget about my needs and only remember at night?
I needed help all day, but only got it at night... I hate it when I'm ignored!
I felt terrible at night but ^CharacterName^ came to help me!
^CharacterName^ was very kind to me, when I thought I'd be ignored.
I just couldn't leave ^CharacterName^ suffering like that...
Why didn't I help ^CharacterName^ sooner? What was I thinking!
Poor kid, I hope {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll get better now that I helped.
Who are we if we let our youngest suffer? How would I be able to look at myself in the mirror if I hadn't helped ^CharacterName^?
I know we're short on supplies, but I just couldn't listen to ^CharacterName^ crying, it was heart-breaking.
I just had to help ^CharacterName^. I know everyone would've done the same, despite our shortage of supplies.
I just couldn't stand that annoying kid's whining anymore. It was better to give {mr|him}{fr|her} what {mr|he}{fr|she} wanted.
Kids have ways of messing with your head, which is why I helped ^CharacterName^ even if it didn’t seem sensible.
Damn it! We're saving supplies for a rainy day and someone wastes them on that useless kid!
Bloody hell! How are we meant to save up anything if ^CharacterName^ gets whatever {mr|he}{fr|she} as soon as {mr|he}{fr|she} starts crying?
Helping ^CharacterName^ was a decent thing to do, but I'm a little worried about our supplies...
I understand ^CharacterName^ needed help, but our supplies are dwindling. We should be saving them.
Poor ^CharacterName^ I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} will get better now.
I wish we had enough supplies for everyone, but I agree that ^CharacterName^ should get them first.
We have to stick together and look after our own. Sharing with ^CharacterName^ first, was the only right thing to do.
Kids are the most vulnerable, we have to protect them at all costs. They should be the first to get food and meds.
It was foolish of ^OtherCharacterName^ to take ^CharacterName^ and leave. No one else will help them.
How could ^OtherCharacterName^ take ^CharacterName^ and just disappear, without saying a word? They're taking a huge risk.
Why did they leave? We were better off together, weren't we?
I wonder where did ^OtherCharacterName^ take ^CharacterName^? They should've stayed here.
^OtherCharacterName^ took ^CharacterName^ and left? Fuck them!
So ^OtherCharacterName^ and that annoying kid are gone? Very well, I don't fucking need them!
They left? Good. I'm better off without that useless kid anyway.
^OtherCharacterName^ rid me of that annoying kid? Finally.
I'm worried about ^CharacterName^ and ^OtherCharacterName^. I hope they're okay.
^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best to take ^CharacterName^ and leave. I blame myself for not trying harder to make them stay.
I wonder if ^CharacterName^ is safer with ^OtherCharacterName^ than here. I hope so, for their sake.
Are ^OtherCharacterName^ and ^CharacterName^ better off on their own? Sadly, I doubt it.
The poor kid has nightmares already... {mr|He}{fr|She}'ll probably have trouble sleeping even after the war is over.
^CharacterName^ had a terrible nightmare and wouldn't go back to sleep for a long time. I wish I knew how to help {mr|him}{fr|her}.
^CharacterName^ already has terrible nightmares. There's a high chance {mr|he}{fr|she}'ll be scarred for the rest of {mr|his}{fr|her} life.
^CharacterName^ had a terrible nightmare and stayed awake for some time afterwards. This might mess with {mr|his}{fr|her} sleep cycle.
^CharacterName^ has terrible nightmares, and there's nothing I can do to help...
Poor kid, will these nightmares never cease to haunt {mr|him}{fr|her}?
^CharacterName^ had a terrible nightmare and couldn't go back to sleep. I should keep watch over {mr|him}{fr|her} the next time.
If that annoying kid doesn't stop being noisy at night, I'm gonna get seriously mad.
Everyone has a bad dream once in a while, what's all the fuss?
^CharacterName^ had a nightmare and just wouldn't go back to sleep, keeping me awake for hours.
This bloody war gives little ^CharacterName^ nightmares! {mr|He}{fr|She} wakes up screaming or crying! I wish there was something I could do to help...
I had a horrible dream! I don't want to go to sleep, I don't want to have this dream again!
I had a dream that I was all alone, hungry and cold, and everyone else was dead... I'm afraid to close my eyes now.
I had a horrible dream... The soldiers were killing everyone, I tried to run away but they chased me, they wanted to kill me too... They caught me and I woke up. I don't want to have this dream ever again.
I had a horrible dream... The soldiers were killing everyone, I tried to run away but they chased me, they wanted to kill me too... They caught me and I woke up. I don't want to have this dream ever again.
Poor ^CharacterName^ had some kind of panic attack, and it pains me that I didn't know what I could do to help...
Poor ^CharacterName^ woke up screaming and had some kind of panic attack. There just was no calming {mr|him}{fr|her} down.
^CharacterName^ panic attacks might have serious consequences. Is there anything we can do about them?
^CharacterName^ woke up screaming and had a panic attack. I wonder if leaving the light on could help {mr|him}{fr|her}.
It's so unfair that kids like ^CharacterName^ have to suffer from insecurity and panic attacks.
^CharacterName^ should have a happy childhood, but instead {mr|he}{fr|she} is so frightened {mr|he}{fr|she} wakes up screaming at night...
Poor ^CharacterName^ woke up screaming and had some kind of panic attack. It took all night to calm {mr|him}{fr|her} down.
How can we get any rest at night, if that kid keeps screaming?!
^CharacterName^ was screaming at night, as if it wasn't bad enough.
^CharacterName^ started screaming in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. What's wrong with this kid?
My poor ^CharacterName^ was panicking at night... Is there anything I can do to ease {mr|his}{fr|her} mind?
^CharacterName^'s obsession with fire is disturbing... Are such things permanent or can they be cured? I wish I'd read about it when I had the chance.
I'm really worried about ^CharacterName^. Last night {mr|he}{fr||she} started a fire, fortunately it was noticed before it could spread. {mr|He}{fr||She} wouldn't say why {mr|he}{fr||she} did this.
^CharacterName^ should be closely watched, else {mr|he}{fr||she} might burn the house down!
This is worrying! Last night ^CharacterName^ started a fire, which was fortunately noticed before it could spread. I think I'd better keep an eye on {mr|him}{fr||her}.
I'm worried about ^CharacterName^, our difficult situation is taking a heavy toll on {mr|his}{fr|her} fragile mind.
I wish there was a way to protect ^CharacterName^ from all the horror and destruction that surrounds us.
Oh, poor ^CharacterName^. This situation bears so heavily on {mr|him}{fr||her} that last night {mr|he}{fr||she} started a fire! Fortunately it didn't spread.
What the fuck? That blasted kid almost burned our house! What's wrong with {mr|him}{fr|her}?
What's this kid's problem? Aren't we in deep enough shit already? Does {mr|he}{fr|she} have to make it even worse?
What a night! ^CharacterName^ has started a fire which was thankfully put out before it could spread. {mr|He}{fr||She}'s becoming a danger!
I hope I can cure ^CharacterName^ of this absurd fascination with fire. Perhaps I should devote more time to playing and talking with {mr|him}{fr|her}.
^CharacterName^ is becoming a really angry kid. I hope it doesn't get worse...
^CharacterName^ had a fit of rage in the evening, screaming and kicking things, and refused to go to bed. It was impossible to calm {mr|him}{fr|her} down until midnight.
Damn it... Trying to get some rest while having to deal with an angry kid is nigh-on impossible.
^CharacterName^ threw a tantrum in the evening, screaming and kicking things, and refused to go to bed. {mr|He}{fr||She} finally collapsed around midnight, exhausted.
^CharacterName^ has anger management problems. I fear about {mr|his}{fr|her} future.
^CharacterName^ is becoming violent. There's a risk that {mr|he}{fr|she} might remain so in the future.
Poor ^CharacterName^ had a fit of rage in the evening, screaming and kicking things, and refused to go to bed. Calming {mr|him}{fr|her} down took a lot of time, almost until midnight.
If that kid doesn't calm down, I'll show {mr|him}{fr|her} what angry really means.
^CharacterName^'s anger management problems are not my concern, as long as I can get a decent sleep.
CharacterName^ was acting up all evening. {mr|He}{fr|She} screamed, kicked things and refused to go to bed until midnight.
I'm worried ^CharacterName^ is becoming violent. I hope it passes when the war is over.
The poor kid doesn't get enough attention, but how can {mr|he}{fr|she}, when there are so many other important problems to deal with.
^CharacterName^ acted distraught, asked for water, complained about the cold and kept it up all night. {mr|He}{fr|She} probably needs more attention.
Oh for crying out loud, doesn't ^CharacterName^ realize there's a war going on? Isn't {mr|he}{fr|she}'s big enough to last a night without pampering?
^CharacterName^ acted distraught, asked for water, complained about the cold and kept it up all night. I guess {mr|he}{fr|she} just wants more attention.
It's really sad that we can't devote enough time to play and talk with ^CharacterName^.
I wish it was possible to spend more time with ^CharacterName^, but let's be honest, there are more important things on my mind right now.
^CharacterName^ was inconsolable tonight, asking for water, complaining of cold and loneliness. {mr|He}{fr|She} desperately needs company.
"I want this, I want that, bring me something, hug me..." ^CharacterName^ should quit whining, we all have it tough right now.
^CharacterName^ wants more attention? Why don't we just drop whatever we're doing and serve the little {mr|prince}{fr|princess}.
^CharacterName^ was unbearable all night, constantly asking for things, complaining and generally demanding attention.
^CharacterName^ really needs a lot of attention now. I should make as much time as possible to play and talk with {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Poor ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} must be really ashamed of what happened at night...
Poor ^CharacterName^ wet the bed in {mr|his}{fr|her} sleep. {mr|He}{fr|She} was understandably upset over this - {mr|he}{fr|she}'s a big {mr|boy}{fr|girl} after all.
^CharacterName^ is just scared, it will pass. What worries me is the fact that we'll have to change and wash the sheets more often than we'd like.
^CharacterName^ wet the bed in {mr|his}{fr|her} sleep. It'll be difficult to keep the clothes and sheets dry, I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} doesn't catch a cold!
Something's clearly wrong with ^CharacterName^, fear and stress are taking their toll on {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Poor ^CharacterName^ wet the bed in {mr|his}{fr|her} sleep. It took {mr|him}{fr|her} a while to accept that this happens to adults as well under such stress and there's nothing to be ashamed about.
Fuck it! I sure ain't sleeping in the same bed as that pissing brat.
If the kid can't control {mr|himself}{fr|herself}, {mr|he}{fr|she} should sleep on the floor.
^CharacterName^ wet the bed in {mr|his}{fr|her} sleep. {mr|He}{fr|She}'s a big {mr|boy}{fr|girl}, accidents like that shouldn't happen to {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Something's wrong with ^CharacterName^, {mr|he}{fr|she} is old enough not to pee in bed. This shouldn't have happened!
It was really disturbing to see a child playing like that...
Last night ^CharacterName^ played with {mr|his}{fr|her} toys in a way I wish I could forget. First {mr|he}{fr|she} was separating "men" from "women", then executing them. Poor kid...
I hope those responsible for war crimes get punished after the fighting's done. Regardless, children will remember.
Last night ^CharacterName^ played with {mr|his}{fr|her} toys, separating "men" from "women", then executing them. Kids include whatever they see in their play, so I guess that's "normal"... A new normal.
That game ^CharacterName^ was playing... Children should never witness such things...
Last night ^CharacterName^ played with {mr|his}{fr|her} toys, separating "men" from "women", then executing them. What this war inflicts on children can never be undone.
The atrocities that both sides have committed are reflected in our children's behavior...
I don't care what ^CharacterName^ plays, as long as {mr|he}{fr|she} remains quiet.
Last night ^CharacterName^ performed a mock execution using {mr|his}{fr|her} toys. This is messed up, kids shouldn't behave like that!
Why did ^CharacterName^ have to see such atrocities? How can people do that to other people?
^CharacterName^ is clearly becoming catatonic. I'd like to help, but I don't know how.
I'm really worried. ^CharacterName^ shut down completely yesterday evening, didn't react to anything, just sat on the floor rocking back and forth. I didn't know what to do.
When all this is over, we should get a psychologist to help ^CharacterName^. But for now there are more important problems than that.
This is serious. ^CharacterName^ became catatonic this evening, just sat on the floor rocking back and forth and didn't react to anything. There must be a way to help {mr|him}{fr|her}!
Poor kid, {mr|his}{fr|her} fragile mind is breaking under pressure.
I'm beside myself with worry. ^CharacterName^ has shut down completely this evening, didn't react to anything, just sat on the floor rocking back and forth. This war can't end soon enough.
It looks really creepy when ^CharacterName^ is rocking back and forth, but at least {mr|he}{fr|she} is quiet.
Tonight ^CharacterName^ acted really weird, just sat on the floor rocking back and forth and didn't answer. I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} gets better, it was unnerving like hell.
I have to help ^CharacterName^, but how do you deal with catatonia?
^CharacterName^ misses {mr|his}{fr|her} friends so much that {mr|he}{fr|she} invented an imaginary one.
^CharacterName^ was talking to someone at night, but when I went to check, there was no one there. It looks that {mr|he}{fr|she} has an imaginary friend! I kinda wish I could have such an escape myself.
^CharacterName^ seems to have invented an imaginary friend. Well, if that helps {mr|him}{fr|her} cope with reality...
I was alarmed when I heard the voice of ^CharacterName^ talking to someone last night, but to my relief there was no one there – it seems {mr|he}{fr|she} just has an imaginary friend. We could all use one...
^CharacterName^ must be very lonely, but this imaginary friend thing is a bit disturbing.
When I went to check on ^CharacterName^ last night, I found {mr|him}{fr|her} talking to {mr|him}{fr|her}self. Looks like {mr|he}{fr|she} has an imaginary friend! I hope it gives {mr|him}{fr|her} some relief.
^CharacterName^ was talking to an empty room last night. Looks like {mr|he}{fr|she} has an imaginary friend! At least {mr|he}{fr|she} isn't bothering me.
^CharacterName^ must be really lonely to have invented an imaginary friend, I'm worried about {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Last night, ^CharacterName^ was so scared that {mr|he}{fr|she} hid in a wardrobe. Poor kid.
When bedtime came, ^CharacterName^ was nowhere to be found. After hours of searching, {mr|he}{fr|she} was found asleep, hidden in a wardrobe. What a relief.
There's only trouble with that kid. Wasting our time hiding like that. What'll {mr|he}{fr|she} think of next?
It was difficult to find ^CharacterName^ when {mr|he}{fr|she} was hiding last night. At least now I know where to look for {mr|him}{fr|her} next time.
It pains me to see ^CharacterName^ so scared. Children should feel safe and loved.
I was worried about ^CharacterName^. I'm glad we found {mr|him}{fr|her} hidden in a wardrobe. I hope that at least {mr|he}{fr|she} felt safe for a while.
^CharacterName^ can sleep in that wardrobe every night for all I care.
^CharacterName^ disappeared this evening, causing a frantic search through all the rooms, only to be found hidden in a wardrobe, asleep. What got into that kid!
I was frightened when I couldn't find ^CharacterName^. It was such a relief to find {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Our new home has broken windows and there are big holes in the walls. I'm sometimes cold, but I have a place out of the rain for my things!
There was no one home at night. I was all alone! I was really scared...
All I do is work and work. It's too much! I'm tired!
I think ^CharacterName^ is working too hard for a kid, {mr|he}{fr|she} deserves a break.
I don't care what happens now. I miss my ^CharacterName^.
^CharacterName^ worries so much that it makes {mr|him}{fr|her} ill. I'm very sad too.
My poor ^CharacterName^, my heart breaks when {mr|he}{fr|she}'s crying. War is especially hard on children...
It's snowing!!! I want to build a snowman and have a snowball fight, but my friends aren't here, and it's very cold, even inside when the fire goes out.
It's snowing!!! I want to build a snowman and have a snowball fight, but my friends aren't here, and it's very cold, even inside when the fire goes out.
I ate so much I thought I'd burst. It feels so good not to have to go to bed hungry!
I ate so much I thought I'd burst. It feels so good not to have to go to bed hungry!
Why does no one want to play with me? Did I do something wrong?
How evil do you have to be to hurt a child?! How could they?! Poor little ^CharacterName^.
Where's ^CharacterName^? Why didn't {mr|he}{fr|she} come back? Is {mr|he}{fr|she} ok?
We invited a new person to live at our home. I'll have someone new to talk and play with!
Someone will come and stay with us for some time. I hope {mr|he}{fr|she} is nice.
Knowing that the child is happy lifts my spirits.
It could be better, but at least the child is doing okay.
It's good to have a child around, but heartbreaking to see it unhappy.
There's nothing worse than watching a helpless child suffer.
Knowing that the child is happy lifts our spirits.

This is for adults. And smells really awful.

I don't really like this place, but it's better than our basement. It was dark and damp in there. And there were rats living there. I hope there are no rats here. I'm afraid of rats. They are icky, they climb over you when you are asleep, and they can bite you!
I hate this place! It has a basement and rats live in basements! I hate rats! They are icky, they climb over you when you are asleep, and they can bite you! I don't want to stay here, I want to go home.
In our basement, there lived this one large rat, the biggest rat ever. Every night he would come out of a hole in the wall, try to snatch some of our food, and scuttle back in. I knew I had to try to stop him.
In our basement there lived a horrible, ugly rat. It was really scary, and every night it would crawl out of its hole and steal some of our food. I would freeze every time I saw it. I knew I had to do something, but I was so scared.
The soldiers stopped everyone from coming into the city, so I asked my friend, who had some toy soldiers to help me stop the rat from coming into our basement. He agreed and we put them on guard in front of the rat-hole. But when night came, the rat just trampled on them. So next time, we placed the soldiers behind a barricade made of bricks and rubble.
Dad was always busy, he said we had more serious problems than rats, he did nothing to help. My friend said that the soldiers stopped everyone from coming into the city, so maybe toy soldiers would stop a rat? We tried putting them in front of the rat-hole, but the rat just trampled on them. We had to do something bigger, so we blocked the hole with bricks and rubble.
Our anti-rat barricade worked! That night the rat retreated! We were victorious! I was so happy about it that I decided to share my last bit of chocolate that I had been saving for my birthday. The next day the soldiers came and we had to leave our basement and look for another place to live. I don't know what happened to that rat.
Our anti-rat barricade worked at first, but the following night the rat broke through it. Rats are unstoppable. What was worse was that it stole the last bit of chocolate that I was saving for my birthday. I felt so miserable. The next day the soldiers came and told us to get out. They didn't even give us time to take our things. I hope that rat eats them!
After the ceasefire came into effect, the whole family reunited. Despite the harsh reality of war, Iskra managed to remain unscarred. She resumed school. When she went to college, she started writing stories for children as a pastime, and became quite popular. Her new best friend, a fat cat that she named "Mr. Whiskers", helped her get rid of her fear of rats.
The family managed to reunite after the ceasefire, but Iskra's experiences did not leave her unscarred. Due to her time in the basement, she developed a phobia of rats and confined spaces. Her mother made sure she had a bright room with a large window, and gave her a cat. Iskra always kept him close at night in case any rats came.
Iskra and her mother cried for hours when they were finally reunited. Both of them had horrible memories, which they chose not to talk about. The happy gleam was gone from Iskra's eyes for years to come. She became terribly frightened of rats and confined spaces. She cannot sleep with the lights out. Even long after the war, she sometimes wakes up screaming at night.
ISKRA DIED ENDLOG DEBUG TEXT
Remember the little girl with the sad eyes, the one that turned up at our door with her father one day? Here's hoping she's alright. With her father protecting her, she must be, right?
When morning light came, Iskra was nowhere to be found. Where did she go? Did she set out to find some help?
Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
Hello, my name is Iskra. My mum is visiting my grandma, so dad looks after me now. We will meet again when the soldiers go away. Dad says that they will go away when other countries send us help. I hope it's soon. I miss mum. I miss my friends. I miss my room, TV and ice cream. Did you know we had to live in the basement? Dad said it was safer like that. Can I look around here?
I would play war games with my friends. We would form two teams and run around with our plastic guns and pretend to shoot each other. If you didn't have a gun, a stick would do. One day we had this great idea, you wanna hear about it?
Dad said I was too young to fight. I was angry, I cried, but he did not change his mind. So he went to fight, and me and my friends would pretend we were brave rebels defending the city against the evil empire that wanted to destroy it.
With rubble and sand we built a barricade in our front yard. We found an old pipe, and we put it on our barricade and pretended it was a cannon. We would pretend to fight off the soldiers, and shoot our cannon at them.
We had our plastic guns, but no tanks and no cannons or planes, so with piles of rubble we built a barricade in our front yard. We put a big broken pipe on it and pretended it was a cannon. We knew we would die fighting the enemy.
We had great fun, until one morning our barricade and our house got bombarded and some people were hurt. Grandpa was very angry with me, he said the soldiers must have thought that our barricade and our cannon were real and they fired their own cannons at us.
One morning we were holding our barricade, when grandpa called me inside for breakfast. I was eating my oats when there was a great boom! And another one and one more! Our house and yard and barricade were hit by bombs! I wanted to run to my friends, but grandpa held me tight, and didn't let me!
Grandpa said we needed to find another place to stay, so we went looking for a nice place, and we came here. When I grow up I won't need a house at all. I will live in a tent like my dad, and fight the bad soldiers like he does.
After the bombing, we had to leave the house and look for some other place to live. When we were leaving, I saw that my friends' graves were in the place where our barricade used to be. One day, I'll grow big and strong, and I will kill all the bad soldiers for what they did!
Henrik did his best to alleviate the effects that the war had on Ivano. He paid for professional psychological help and sent him to a good school. Ivano found a way to express himself through street art, and became quite famous. Once a year he lights a candle for his father by the Unknown Soldiers' memorial in Pogoren.
Ivano never saw his father again, but always imagined him as a war hero. As a teenager, Ivano joined a nationalist paramilitary group, dreaming of the Independent Republic of Vysena that his father had fought and died for. When the time comes, he will be ready to pick up arms.
His war experiences caused Ivano to become very aggressive, particularly towards the Grazni. Convinced that violence is the right way to solve all problems, he had difficulties adjusting to school life and ended up in a reformatory school. Eventually he joined an extremist terrorist group.
Henrik and Ivano were unfortunate, but what could we have done? An old man and a kid - two more mouths to feed, with little or no use to us.
We have not seen Ivano since the night he left the shelter. Did he go looking for his father? If so, let's hope he found him.
Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
My dad is fighting the bad soldiers. He is brave and won't let them into the city. He said I am too young to fight, but when I grow up I will be just like him. But don't tell grandpa, he doesn't like soldiers. Hey, do you know how to play war games?
I love mommy and daddy very much. Mommy sings, and brushes my hair, and daddy reads me bedtime stories, and takes me horse riding. I really miss them both, but I understand why they have to be away.
I miss mommy and daddy a lot. My hair is dirty and not brushed, and no one reads me bedtime stories or takes me horse riding. I don’t understand why they have to be away, I need them!
Those people are fighting now, and this is all very sad, so mommy and daddy went to heaven to ask the angels to make them stop. It’s important, so we must stay here with you or with our uncle until they come back… and they promised that we would go to Africa and that it would be great!
There are so many bad people everywhere now. Bad people want to hurt you. If mommy and daddy were here, nobody would hurt us. But they’re not. They can’t protect us. Grozdan says they are happy now, but how can they be happy without us? I want them back, I want them to take us to Africa, like they promised…
In Africa we’ll have adventures like the heroes of my favorite book, “In Desert and Wilderness”. Daddy used to read it to me before I went to sleep. It’s about a little girl Nel and her older friend Staś, who is brave and good, and just like Grozdan.
I want to have adventures in Africa like Nel and Staś, the heroes of my favorite book, “In Desert and Wilderness”. Here in the city only bad things happen. I want to be far away with mommy and daddy and Grozdan. Why hasn’t he come back yet? He would never leave me behind, would he?
Nel and Staś are kidnapped by some bad people, but then escape and have adventures. They travel, meet lions, and even make friends with an elephant! And in the end they meet their parents again and everyone is happy! It will be the same with us, won’t it?
Even though there were people fighting in Africa too, Staś would never leave Nel, except for one time when he went to look for medicine for her. Grozdan will soon be back, won’t he? I really want him back. And my parents too… I’m not crying, it’s just… I have something in my eye…
When the fighting was over, Grozdan came back for Kalina. Their uncle’s family was alright and took them in as their own. They helped Kalina cope with the loss of her parents. She remained religious and many years after the war in Graznavia, she went to Africa with a charity, to help the children there.
Despite the odds, Grozdan managed to reach their uncle, who took them in as soon as the siege was lifted. Even though her uncle’s family did all they could, Kalina remained a melancholic and quiet child, always reading or daydreaming to escape the real world that had been so harsh to her.
Grozdan managed to reach their uncle’s house, but there was no one there. He came back for Kalina as soon as the ceasefire came into effect. With no adult guardians, they ended up in an orphanage. It was a sad childhood, as they grew up traumatized by the war, having only each other. They never went to Africa.
The pleas of the young boy to look after his sister until he came back fell on deaf ears. What happened to those children afterwards had better remain a secret.
One night, Kalina left the relative safety of the shelter to look for her brother. The other survivors would never hear of her again.
Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
Hello, my name is Kalina, what’s your name? We can be friends. I don’t have many friends now that everyone is fighting. Only my brother. He is my best friend, he looks after me, and says everything will be alright. He went to look for our uncle, who will come for us and take us far away from the angry people who fight each other. And then mommy and daddy will come back.
Hi, I’m Grozdan and this is my younger sister Kalina. We have no place to stay, but our uncle has a house on the outskirts. I can try to reach him, if you look after Kalina for a couple of days. She’s a good girl, she won’t cause any trouble. You look kind-hearted, will you please help us?
I hope daddy comes back soon. And mommy too. I know they don't like each other now, but they don't argue as much as they did before she moved out. Maybe we'll live together again someday.
I wish my parents didn't argue so much. Mommy always wanted to move out of the city and dad used to shout at her saying that she wanted us to live like beggars. If they didn't shout so much maybe she would be still with me. I miss her.
I called my mom every day after the day she moved out. I would tell her about my friends and she always asked about school and what I had had for dinner. But then the phone stopped working and daddy said it couldn't be fixed.
I think daddy should be back any time now. I wish I could call my mommy and tell her to come. I used to call her every day when the phone still worked. She promised me that she would come to my birthday. But she didn't.
It's taking my daddy an awfully long time to find a new home for us. I hope it will be nice. Our home was very nice, we had a garden and a swing. On my birthday we had a big party with my friends from school. I hoped that my mom would come, but daddy said she couldn't.
The day before my birthday, I asked daddy if mom was coming. He said he didn't know, that it was dangerous to move around the city. I cried, and he gave me presents to make me stop. My friends came and we had a party, but mom didn't come. It was my worst birthday ever.
On the night after my birthday, there was a lot of shooting and shouting outside and in the morning, daddy told me that we had to go. We couldn't even take my doll's pram. I hope those people will stop shooting at each other. Why can't they just sit down and talk it out?
I couldn't sleep because there were people shouting and shooting in the street. In the morning, dad packed some things and said that we had to run. I left almost all of my toys. Even my new pram. Why do people keep fighting like that? It´s worse than arguing and shouting.
After the end of the fighting, Evgeni quickly found Lydia's mother. They are still divorced, but Lydia sees her mother every week. And the big doll house that she got from her is her favorite toy.
When the war ended, Lydia's mother managed to find her living close to their old place. She insisted that everything that had happened to her was Evgeni's fault.
After the war, Lydia moved with her father to live with their relatives in the country. She has never seen her mother again.
Evgeni seemed like a resourceful guy, he must have managed to find some other temporary refuge for his ladies.
Lydia disappeared one quiet night and after wandering the streets for days she was saved by humanitarian workers. After the war, her mother found her through the Red Cross.
Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
What did you get for your birthday? I got a pram for my doll and a t-shirt with a princess on it from my daddy. I don't know what my mom will give me. She's not living at home anymore. And now she won't find us here, daddy says he left her a message but he didn't know what address to use, but he says he'll let her know somehow. I hope she comes back and stays with me. Even if she doesn't have any presents. I know it's hard to get presents now.
When will Daniel come back? He's my friend. I didn't know him so well before but he has been really nice to me since he found me. I hope he comes back soon with my parents. I miss them. I was sitting at the big table with them eating breakfast when the soldiers came and said that there was an evacuation and that we had to get to the trucks.
Do you think something happened to Daniel? He said he'll be back soon. Did he lie? He lived next to us but I didn't know him so well. I miss him now. I miss my parents. The last time I saw them was when we were eating breakfast and the soldiers started banging on the door and shouting that we had to get to the trucks because there was an evacuation.
My mom and dad started grabbing and packing things and I told them I had to go and get Roxy. I found her on the next street, but when we returned, everybody had gone. Daniel later said they thought that I must have already got on another truck. I fed Roxy and I had some milk and cookies, and we went to sleep.
My parents started to run to and fro grabbing things and I said I’d go and get Roxy. I found her on the next street and took her to my parents. But they left without me. They always said they'd never ever leave me, but they lied. I ate cookies and I gave Roxy her food. And then we waited. But they didn't come.
One night, Roxy woke me up barking loudly and I heard terrible noises. I hid in my hideout because I knew that the thieves had come. Roxy fought them but they shot her. She saved my life. The thieves had left by morning, but they made a terrible mess and stole all our food.
One night, Roxy started to growl and bark and I heard a bang and then she started to whine and there was another bang. I was in my hideout and I wanted to help her but I was scared. I heard steps and noises all through the night, and in the morning I found Roxy and she was dead. And there was no food left.
I buried Roxy with her bowl and her toys and her blanket, and I marked the place on the wall. I didn't know what to do, so I waited. Then Daniel found me and took me with him. He said that Roxy is in heaven for saving me, and that one day I'll see her again. I just wish she was here, and my parents too. I have so much to tell them.
I dug a hole and put her in and I had to cover her with earth because that's what you do. Her paws were sticking out and I couldn't bend them, so I brought sand from the sandbox. Then Daniel came and took me with him. He said Roxy is in heaven and promised to find my parents. But I think he lied. I think they're with Roxy.
Daniel quickly found Misha's parents and there was a tearful, joyous reunion. The nightmares soon ended and Misha recovered fully.
Daniel eventually managed to locate Misha's parents, but the family never returned to their home in Pogoren, marred by the dreadful memories.
Misha had to wait a long time for his parents. They were eventually reunited, but what they had lived through changed them all forever.
Daniel found another temporary home for Misha, he managed to slip through the front line and locate Misha's parents, but they had to wait for the end of fighting before returning.
Misha ran away in the middle of the night and was taken in by a childless couple. He was eventually reunited with his parents.
Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
Why don't you have a dog? I had a dog when I was living with my parents. Her name was Roxy and my dad gave her to me. You should get a dog. It should be big, bigger than Roxy, and with big teeth! Roxy was small because our apartment was small. But she was the best anyway. I taught her to fetch.
Thank heavens! I'm Daniel, and this is Misha, my neighbors' kid. Could you take care of him for a few days? I promised him I’d find his parents and I won't risk sneaking out of the city with a child in tow.
I... kind of lied about my parents. I'm sorry. I was in an orphanage since I was very small. I thought that you'd change your mind if you knew. But Oleg is real! We're not related, but we swore to be like brothers.
You know, what I told you about myself is not all true. We're not so rich and... actually the only true part was about my brother. Only he's not my real brother. I'm sorry. I was afraid you'd kick me out if you knew I was an orphan.
So my brother Oleg, he's really smart, but on the smaller side, and the other kids kept pushing him around. Especially Vano, a big boy who was almost a grown-up. Nobody would stand up to him. So one night I sneaked into his dorm.
Oleg is a bit small and he was often bullied. And there was this guy Vano who really shouldn't be still in school, he was almost a grown-up, and he... liked to do things to kids. Adult things. And Oleg told me he tickled him and said that he'll "have fun" with him soon.
I left pincers stolen from the workshop on his bed, and I stuck a note to his pillow: "If you touch Oleg, you'll never count to 10 on your fingers again." And that was the end of it. Afterwards Oleg and I swore to each other that from now on we'd be like brothers.
I sneaked into Vano's dorm at night and put a blade to his throat, and when he woke up, I whispered that I'll carve him a second smile if he so much as looks at Oleg. And that was the end of it. Afterwards Oleg and I swore to each other that from now on we'd be like brothers.
We were meant to be flown out of town before it got really bad, but there was not enough space on the plane. So older kids had to stay. But when we returned to the school, the army arrested all the staff and told us to go away. When it's over, I'm going to find Oleg, whatever it takes.
When the shells started to fall, they took us to the airport to fly us from Pogoren. Oleg went on the plane and I was left behind. And when I returned to school, the army rounded up all the staff and told us to get lost. I'll probably never see Oleg again.
As soon as it was possible, Sergei started inquiring about Oleg and after a few months they were reunited in a new foster home.
It took a long time for the bad memories to fade, but Sergei's life took a turn for the better when Oleg and his new foster parents found him at last.
After the war Sergei did what he could to forget his ordeal. Soon he landed in a juvenile detention center for theft and burglary.
Sergei's plea was turned down, but he somehow managed to survive till the war's end.
Sergei decided he'd be better off on his own and wandered away one night. Some good people found him lying in the street and took him in.
Concerned with the wellbeing of ^CharacterName^, ^OtherCharacterName^ decided it was best for them to leave the shelter and seek help elsewhere.
Thanks for letting me in. My parents are very rich and they'll find a way to make it up to you when it's all over. I lived with them in a big house up there on the hill, and we had everything, even a swimming pool! And I had my own bike, and a rifle, and my father took me hunting once... No, actually several times. We were very happy. When this is over my parents will come to pick me up and I'll introduce you to my younger brother. His name is Oleg and he's very smart!
Please, can I stay with you? I'm hungry and I have nowhere to go... The army took over my home and kicked me out and I don't know what happened to my parents. Please, let me in, I don't eat much and I'll behave, I promise!
Many people in our area moved to their basements as a precaution. We all felt much safer there, even though the life conditions were not the best. I heard stories of people buried alive in their basements, but I didn't tell them to Iskra, I didn't want her to be afraid.
The shellings forced many people from our area to cower in their basements. The walls would shake, the plaster would fall off the ceiling. We would huddle down in fear, Iskra in tears. Everyone thought of the possibility of getting buried alive.
When a shell hit our house, burying our neighbors in their basement, everyone rushed to help. We managed to pull out our neighbor and her son, but her husband had been crushed. Iskra did not see him, but since that day she has been having nightmares of being buried beneath the rubble.
One day our tenement was hit by a shell. We survived, but our neighbors were less fortunate. Their basement collapsed, burying them underneath tons of rubble. We managed to pull out our neighbor and her son, but her husband was crushed. Iskra saw his mangled body and has had horrible nightmares ever since.
Despite my daughter’s fears, I decided that staying in the basement was safer than not. I thought of it as a temporary arrangement. I didn't expected the siege to last very long, but it turned out we spent many months there. Everyone from our tenement shared whatever they had and helped each other.
After that fateful day, we no longer felt any safer staying in the basement, but we had nowhere to go regardless. Our days became bleak as our supplies dwindled, and every day could be our last. It seemed like the siege would last forever, and I started losing hope of seeing my wife ever again.
One day the soldiers came and told us to get out. They gave everyone a minute or two to evacuate, and then they threw in grenades. People they suspected of helping the rebels were shot on sight. They let us go because Iskra had no one else but me.
All this ended, when, one day, soldiers came to our house. They were sweeping the city for rebels and their supporters, throwing grenades into random basements. We weren't there when it happened, but most of our neighbors were killed. We didn't go down there to grab our things. We left, never to come back.
When the war ended, Christo managed to reunite with his wife. Luckily she was unhurt. They resumed work, and did their best to alleviate the effects war had on Iskra, as well as ensure she had a normal childhood. Perhaps with a lot of love and care, they would succeed.
Christo's family reunion was a bittersweet one. Though they were all alive, Christo's experiences changed him, making him quiet and withdrawn. Even when peace settled in, he rarely participated in social meetings, preferring to spend time alone and if possible, outdoors.
Despite his family's reunion after the ceasefire, Christo could not forget the horrors of war, and that changed him. His wife tried to help him, but he pushed her away, and they slowly grew apart. They stayed together for Iskra's sake, but their marriage was nothing but an empty shell of what it had been.
Christo died during the siege of Pogoren, leaving Iskra with only her mother and grandmother. She would always miss him.
Christo and his daughter had to look for some other place to stay. Hopefully they got lucky, and survived the war. We will probably never know.
Desperate, Christo left the shelter one night, never to come back.
Completely broken, Christo chose to take his own life. How did it come to pass?
One night, ^CharacterName^ left the shelter taking ^OtherCharacterName^ with {ms|him}{fs|her}. They somehow managed to reach a refugee camp, where they spent the rest of the war.
We used to live not far from here. When the first shellings started, we moved into the basement for safety. We tried to make it as comfortable as possible, but it was still cold, dark and damp. There were also rats. Iskra is afraid of them, but I told her she had to be strong. She spent most of the time in that basement, while I went out each day to get some supplies.
With Christo dead, little Iskra will only have her mother left.
Hello, my name is Christo, and this is my daughter Iskra. We had been living in the basement of our house for the last couple of months but the soldiers forced us to leave. You look like decent people, so I'll ask you straight: Can we stay with you? Iskra is too young, but I'll work to earn it. As a teenager I used to help my parents a lot in chopping wood to heat our house, so that can be my duty here as well. What do you say?
It's not easy to look after my grandson in the midst of all this chaos, but I have no choice. My son is an idealist, and believes he is fighting for a better future for Ivano. The boy adores him, and believes his dad is a hero. I just hope he's alright.
Can you hear the shots? Every time I hear them I think of my son. Is he the one firing? Is he under fire, about to die? This whole war is madness. I tried to talk some reason into my son, but he wouldn't listen. He has always defied me.
I know my son fell victim to clever propaganda. I do not know who is really behind this war, or who will benefit from it, but I'm sure it won't be the Vyseni people. Graznavia has been a multicultural country for centuries, this attempt at secession doesn't make much sense.
My son kept prattling about the liberation of the Vyseni people from Grazni oppression, about freedom and independence. Catchy words, used by the hatemongers. We lived alongside the Grazni in peace for centuries, why kill them now? But as soon as the opportunity arose he joined those damned “liberation” forces.
I hope this foolish son of mine doesn't get himself killed. Ivano needs a father, even more so than other kids, since he never knew his mother. The boy looks up to my son, and emulates him in everything. I'm glad he isn't older, or he would've gone fighting too.
My son doesn't come over to visit. He used to do so when the conflict began, but now that both sides are bogged down in protracted siege, I never see him. Not that it would be easy for him to find us here. Our house is ruined, and I have no way of letting him know where we are.
I wonder where my son is now... is he leading his colleagues to battle? Hiding from mortar fire in some trench? Killing Grazni informers? Smoking a cigarette, oblivious and numb, knowing that his cause is lost? I don't care, I just want to hug my son again.
I have so many questions I'd like to ask my son... What is the point of this goddamn war? How many people has he killed? Did he commit atrocities against civilians? Is he a war criminal? But for all I know, I might never see him again. What will I tell Ivano then?
The end of war could not come soon enough for the desperate residents of Pogoren. The city was once more open, but Henrik's son did not return. He could be dead or in hiding, but deep inside, Henrik knew he did not commit any war crimes, and he kept only fond memories of him. Ivano became his chance to correct his past mistakes.
Christo's family reunion was a bittersweet one. Though they were all alive, Christo's experiences changed him, making him quiet and withdrawn. Even when peace settled in, he rarely participated in social meetings, preferring to spend time alone and if possible, outdoors.
For Henrik, the end of war did not mean the end of suffering. His son was killed during the siege. His unit was believed to have committed numerous crimes against the civilian population. Henrik was shattered and became bitter and apathetic. He took his son’s faults as his own failure.
Sadly, Henrik died before he had the chance to reconcile with his son.
Despite their pleading, the old man and his grandson had to look for another place to stay.
Henrik disappeared from the shelter in the dead of night. He set out to find his son, but only learned where he was buried.
Pushed to the edge, Henrik decided life was no longer worth living. What would become of Ivano?
One night, ^CharacterName^ left the shelter taking ^OtherCharacterName^ with {ms|him}{fs|her}. They somehow managed to reach a refugee camp, where they spent the rest of the war.
I regret we could not meet in other circumstances. Before this whole damned affair, I had been enjoying my retirement and looking after Ivano, when my son was at work. When those pro-secessionists started rousing the Vyseni minority, I told my son nothing good would come of it, but he wouldn't listen. He was captivated by the idea of independent Republic of Vysena. He joined the rebels, leaving Ivano with me. I haven't seen him since the siege began.
Poor Henrik. With him dead, what will become of Ivano?
Good morning, my name is Henrik, and this brave boy here is my grandson Ivano. We see you’ve taken refuge in this building, and were wondering if perhaps we could join you here? The more the merrier, they say, and I can be useful too. When the going was tough, I used to make moonshine and cigarettes to sell, and I could do it now as well. So, what do you say?
This place is definitely better than the street, but I wish we could still live in the house Evgeni built for his family. It was small, but so nice! And the garden was just delightful. I used to spend most of my free time there when I moved in.
Oh, things aren't really looking up, are they? We used to live in a really nice house my brother built, and to move here... This isn't a proper place for a child, although it's better than freezing in the street, I guess. I just hope I can make it a bit more bearable with some plants.
There is absolutely no reason to worry about Evgeni. He's really resourceful, I'm sure he'll be back soon. His wife was mad to leave him. Perhaps she had been right when she said it would be best for them to move to the country, but who knew what was coming?
I'm sure Evgeni knows what he's doing, but I'm starting to worry. Why hasn't he returned yet? He was always full of ideas, but some of them just stank. Like marrying that harpy. The only good thing she did was leaving him. If only poor Lydia understood this.
Lydia is lucky to have such a doting father. Well, were she mine, I'd be doting over her too. I try not to spoil her too much, but Evgeni should go about finding someone suitable, and soon. She needs a proper mother.
Evgeni has always been the perfect father. His daughter means everything to him. It's really troubling that he's away for so long, she misses him, poor dear. I worry that something serious must've happened to him.
I can't imagine what's taking Evgeni so long, but he better throw a big party when he returns. Lydia is beside herself and I just don't know how to appease her anymore. Well, we can only carry on and wait some more...
Why hasn't my brother married someone suitable? Lydia wouldn't have to live without a mother, and I dread that I'll have to explain to her that her father won't return for some time, if ever... Why has it happened to this poor child?!
After the fighting ceased, Evgeni finally managed to return. When he related his ordeals to his sister, she forgave him instantly.
When Evgeni managed to find his daughter and sister, Irina berated him for months for, as she said, "abandoning" them. But she eventually got over it.
Evgeni eventually managed to get back to her daughter and sister, but Irina couldn't forgive him for, as she insisted on calling it, "abandoning" them.
Lydia cried for weeks for her aunt, and Evgeni was broken upon learning about Irina's death.
Evgeni seemed like a resourceful guy, he must have managed to find some other temporary refuge for his ladies.
Irina decided she would not stay a day longer in the shelter. She spent the rest of the war in a refugee camp.
Nobody expected Irina to take her own life. She didn't seem like a person capable of doing such a thing.
One night, ^CharacterName^ left the shelter taking ^OtherCharacterName^ with {ms|him}{fs|her}. They somehow managed to reach a refugee camp, where they spent the rest of the war.
Poor Lydia, what she has to go through! First her mother leaves her, and now this! There are so many bad people in the world, I tell you, and to think that this sweet girl has one of them as her mother... Sorry, you probably have enough on your mind already. I joke that I always had a better way with plants than with people, I love to help them grow lush, healthy and delicious.
Here lies Irina, who meant nobody any harm. I hope Evgeni is alright, for Lydia's sake.
Great! Look, I have to ask you for a favor, but you won't regret it, I promise. I had to flee from my home with my daughter and sister, but I know some people who owe me - I just need to meet them and arrange for a place for us and squeeze them for some supplies. And I'll share them with you when I'm back for my ladies.

Oh, hello there! Can you call your parents please?
Oh, hello there! Can you call your parents please?
Hi there kid, is there anyone else home?
Hello! Be a good kid and fetch a grown-up, will you?
Bad dreams.
Some dreams are horrible. They come to you when you sleep, and you can't hide or run away from them, and you're all alone and no one can help you.
Someone wanted to stay with us, but we refused.
Someone was seeking shelter.
^CharacterName^ was very sick.
^CharacterName^ got so ill {ms|he}{fs|she} could barely talk. I tried to cover {ms|him}{fs|her} to keep {ms|him}{fs|her} warm, but {ms|he}{fs|she} kept shaking.
^CharacterName^ was hurt.
^CharacterName^ was hurt so badly that I started crying, because I thought {ms|he}{fs|she} would die.
^CharacterName^ died.
My ^CharacterName^ died. I cried all night. I wanted to die too.
A new home.
We found a new home. We were to stay here until the war is over.
Winter.
Winter was very cold, but at least I could build a snowman! Too bad my friends weren't there to see it.
Sad ^CharacterName^.
My ^CharacterName^ was very sad and cried a lot. I didn't want {ms|him}{fs|her} to be sad, but I didn't know what to do to help.
Child's despair.
It's heartbreaking to watch a child plunge into sorrow. It's an image you can't forget.
Wounded child.
Some bastards wounded little ^CharacterName^. How could they?! {ms|He}{fs|She}'s just a child!
Feeling very ill.
One day I got very ill. I don't remember much from that time. I thought I wouldn't get better.
Empty belly.
I was really, really hungry, but there was nothing to eat. My tummy hurt, I don't want to be so hungry ever again.
^CharacterName^ and ^OtherCharacterName^ left.
Did they find a safe place to stay? Are they okay? One can only hope.
Alone when burglars came.
Some people came to hurt me and take our things, and there was no one to stop them! I was scared! I don't want to be alone ever again!
Ignored and feeling lonely
No one had time for me and everyone ignored me... I hated it.
All alone in the dark
I was left all alone at night. I was frightened someone would come and hurt me!
I'm worried about you ^CharacterName^, you must eat.
I brought you something to eat, ^CharacterName^.
You look hungry ^CharacterName^, here I brought you some food.
Ivano

War is not a playground. Sometimes the situation will force you to get into a fight. You can meet people who will be hostile towards you. Remember that you are not defenseless.

Ghost House
A man who lived there used to give shelter to people in need. He either died or fled after his home has been ravaged by mortar fire. Since then the house stands abandoned, and neighborhood kids say that it's haunted.
It’s deserted… I don’t expect to meet anyone inside.
Dear Subira! Just when I managed to reach this country we thought to be safe, it too was plunged into war. Don't worry though, I'm fine. I write this letter waiting for a man who can smuggle me to safety in his boat. I will then apply for the asylum, and as soon as I get it, I'll bring you here, and we'll be together again, away from war and misery. Hang on and pray for me. Kofi.
Ahoy my friend! I'm Karel.
Would you like to get away from this place?
I can get you and your family to safety. Trust me.
I did it many times. Plenty of people want out.
I've heard of you from the trader. I'll swing by in a while. Think about my offer.
Wanna take a look at my boat?
Here it is, big enough don't you think?
Hey buddy, it's Karel.
No, still nothing.
I'll let you know when I have someone.
So, a searchlight "malfunction" again?
Then point it a bit higher, and we'll slip under.
Almost forgot... time to speak to Igor.
Hold on... I'll talk to you later
Me too... catch you later.
Come closer, it won't bite... hahaha.
Whoa!
You scared the shit out of me.
Another soul here?
Did you hear about the people smugglers?
These bastards! They took all I had!
Food, medicines, jewelry, and they cheated me.
I lost everything. Even my family.
To hell with all of this.
You know, they built this airport for the world cup.
This airport used to be alive, full of people back then.
Few years ago I was waiting for my flight right here.
You better watch out for these slimy people smugglers.
Before the war I had a villa and three cars, now I have nowhere to go.
The worst thing in the war are other people.
Think about my offer, it's the only way.
I have a lot of customers, you are not the only one.
You better stay away from the airport, it's a dangerous place.
Our "trip" is pretty expensive, we have to pay the soldiers to look away.
You are lucky that you met me.
Go ahead and kill me!
Do me a favor and finish it quickly.
Want to take my worthless life? I don't care anymore.
Want to kill me? Hahaha!
Escape
The smuggler's boat carried its passengers to safety, leaving behind the burning city and its residents. Those who managed to escape from the siege of Pogoren would never forget it.
The boat reaches a safe shore.
You have escaped.
Soon after Marko stepped out of the boat, he found his wife and kids, who avoided the worst atrocities hidden away by a kind family. When the war ended, they came back to Pogoren. Normalcy returned to the city. Buildings were rebuilt. Schools and shops reopened. Life went on.
Marin waited out the war in the country, and soon set about finding the boy who once brightened his day. His efforts failed, so he rebuilt his house and kept the action figure in the shop window.</n>And one winter afternoon, the entrance bell rang and the familiar smile has once again filled Marin's workshop - and his life – with light.
After the escape, Roman kept away from fighting. Once the war ended, he sought out his former buddies. Much to his great relief, he learnt that most of them admired his courage and the decision he made. He returned to his neighborhood and became a leader of the local community.
Stepping out of the boat, Boris resolved to leave the horrors of war behind and used his grit and strength to help others rebuild their lives. The memory of Ana's sacrifice and Luka's faith supported him till the end of his days.
After leaving Pogoren and waiting out the war, Arica gave her father a symbolic funeral, and kept his picture. Despite the horrors she witnessed, she managed to start a family and tried to be a better parent than her father had been.
After leaving Pogoren and waiting out the war, Bruno set off looking for his friend. Her neighborhood was turned into ruins, but she found shelter in the basement which somehow held. Despite the hardships she managed to survive and was happy to see Bruno alive as well. They remain friends to this day.
Safe from immediate threat, Anton lived to see the end of fighting. Although war left deep marks on his character, he returned to teaching with newfound determination. And while too old for the Fields Medal, he's still eligible for the equally prestigious Abel Prize.
When the boat reached the safe shore, Emilia resolved to do everything to prevent another war. After the ceasefire she became a public prosecutor in Pogoren and used her law expertise in trials of war criminals. She has never found out who the murderers of her family were, but deep inside she hopes they got what they deserved.
After leaving Pogoren and waiting out the war, Pavle spent months searching for his wife and son. Despite numerous difficulties, he found out that they had sought refuge in France. He went there to live with them. They never came back to Pogoren.
Nothing could extinguish the flame that drove Cveta to give everything to her calling. Once the war ended, she returned to her duties, and got a visit from a former pupil - the same who made a frantic call one Friday to make sure that his old school had really been evacuated.
Zlata left Pogoren behind for good. After the war she was reunited with her brother in Canada. It took her some time to adjust to the new reality, but she found a job, and even resumed her music studies - at the Royal Conservatory in Toronto.
Once she left Pogoren, Katia used her contacts to find her parents in a refugee camp abroad. After the war, she brought them back to the city and helped rebuild their house.

When the smuggler’s boat reached the safe shore, ^CharacterName^ rushed home. Though shaken, underfed and exhausted {ms|he}{fs|she} knew that this affair could’ve ended up much worse than that. {ms|He}{fs|She} would never come back to Pogoren again.
As soon as the fighting stopped, ^CharacterName^ returned home, heart pounding with fear of what {ms|He}{fs|She} might await {ms|him}{fs|her} there. Miraculously, the house was still standing and {ms|his}{fs|her} mother was alright.

Out of the besieged city, Zlata managed to survive the war, but she lost her optimism and cheerfulness. She returned to Pogoren instead of joining her brother. "I would only remind him of past horrors", she explained. "No, it will be better if I stay. I must tend to our parents' grave."

After ^CharacterName^ fled from Pogoren, {ms|he}{fs|she} managed to wait out the war in the country.

Several months after the war {ms|he}{fs|she} thrown {ms|himself}{fs|herself} under a train.
After fleeing the city, ^CharacterName^ went back home. When the end of war came, {ms|he}{fs|she} tried to find something about the young model {ms|he}{fs|she} had met in Pogoren but failed. Most likely she did not survive. A handful of pictures and memories was all that was left of her.
After fleeing Pogoren, ^CharacterName^ discovered that {ms|his}{fs|her} fears came true. Years of separation put their feelings to the test, and {ms|Kate}{fs|John} eventually gave up on {ms|him}{fs|her}. The hope of seeing {ms|his}{fs|her} love again was what kept ^CharacterName^ alive through the war. Now {ms|his}{fs|her} life became empty and pointless. {ms|His}{fs|Her} depression discouraged others from attaching themselves to {ms|him}{fs|her}, and {ms|he}{fs|she} remained lonely for the rest of {ms|his}{fs|her} life.
When ^CharacterName^ got back to {ms|his}{fs|her} parents after the war, it turned out they were both dying of lung disease. Several months after the war, ^CharacterName^ buried them at Pogoren cemetery. With a heavy heart {ms|he}{fs|she} resumed work at the pharmacy, but all the joy of success was gone, replaced with deep, lingering sadness.
^CharacterName^ fled from Pogoren, but when the war ended, {ms|he}{fs|she} had problems adapting. Like many people in similar circumstances {ms|he}{fs|she} found solace in drinking.

When the smuggler’s boat reached the safe shore, ^CharacterName^ rushed home. The horrors {ms|he}{fs|she} witnessed and was part of would scar {ms|him}{fs|her} forever. {ms|He}{fs|She} would never feel safe again, and would always keep an ample stash of food and most important supplies, just in case.

^CharacterName^ fled Pogoren, but the things {mr|he}{fr|she} witnessed and did during the war made {mr|him}{fr|her} lose conviction. {mr|He}{fr|She} did not return to work as a police officer, nor did {mr|he}{fr|she} think {mr|himself}{fr|herself} worthy of {mr|his}{fr|her} beloved. They never saw each other again.
Iskra and her mother cried for hours when they were finally reunited. Both of them had horrible memories, which they chose not to talk about.

Even long after the war, she sometimes wakes up screaming at night.
After fleeing Pogoren, Ivano managed to wait out the war in hiding. His war experiences caused him to become very aggressive, particularly towards the Grazni. Convinced that violence is the right way to solve all problems, he had difficulties adjusting to school life and ended up in a reformatory school. Eventually he joined a terrorist group.
While Kalina was leaving Pogoren, her brother managed to reach their uncle’s house, but there was no one there.

Despite his family's reunion after the ceasefire, Christo could not forget the horrors of war, and that changed him. His wife tried to help him, but he pushed her away, and they slowly grew apart. They stayed together for Iskra's sake, but their marriage was nothing but an empty shell of what it had been.
The end of war came soon after Henrik left Pogoren, but it didn’t end his suffering. His son was killed during the siege. His unit was believed to have committed numerous crimes against the civilian population. Henrik was shattered and became bitter and apathetic. He took his son’s faults as his own failure.
Only after the ceasefire went into effect, Evgeni managed to find his daughter and sister. Irina couldn't forgive him for, as she insisted on calling it, "abandoning" them.
When the hostilities ended, Henrik returned to Pogoren to wait for his son, but to no avail. Ivano would have to grow up without parents, while Henrik would live the rest of his days brooding over his family’s fate. He would never be sure if his son did not commit any war crimes.
Port
The river port used to be the safest way to escape from Pogoren, until the army set up the searchlights and started to halt all vessels attempting to leave the city - and shoot up those who didn’t comply.
What a pity that all the boats either sailed or sank.
I better watch out for the soldiers.
Airport
The last plane left long time ago. Now the airspace over Pogoren is closed for civilian traffic, and the army shoots down any offenders. They keep a permanent outpost in the control tower.
Here’s the deal
I talked to my friends on the other side and arranged everything. We can get you out safely in a few days. But the ride ain’t free, you know, they need to pay for some… distraction to get the sergeant off their backs. So, you got the goods?

Hey, it’s me, Karel! From the port!
We talked, remember?
It’s serious business!
Open up! I got to go soon!
Hey, it’s me, Karel!

So, you thought over my offer?
I hope you’re all set.
Let’s not waste time.
The boat’s waiting!
Karel
Milan
The army boasts over the radio that they destroyed a gang smuggling people out of the city by boat. It was the only way to evacuate those in dire need of medical aid, so let’s hope that it’s just bluster as usual.
Karel’s note
It’s a note from Karel confirming that you paid for the passage. It contains directions that will lead you to a safe house once you disembark.
A hastily scrawled note reads: I came but you weren’t home. If the deal is still on, be in the port on the next moonless night and I’ll get you out, if you got the goods. Karel.
Someone left a note: “Dad, we left for good. If you convince Tesa to part with her jewels, you can save both of you too. Talk to Karel at the port.”
Someone wrote on the wall: “We left the city. Karel at the port will tell you more.”
There's a note: "Sofia, we took your jewelry. I am so sorry. We have to pay the boatman who'll smuggle us out. We can't wait any longer. I'll make it up to you a hundred times. Leon.
It’s a child’s drawing of people in a boat. Big letters under it read: “Mika! Daddy takes us to grandpa in a boat! Please come too so we can play.”
Someone left a note: “Tomas, the boatman says we can’t wait any longer. Join us at the port tonight if you can. I pray you’re well.”
A crude drawing of a boat, and under it: “WANT OUT? Go to the port!” Is this an advertisement?
A crumpled handwritten note reads: "Vlad, keep the bloody AA launchers out of the hands of your goddamned volunteers! I can't pin another massacre on the rebels! Next time a civilian plane goes down, I'm throwing you to the wolves."

Plush Dog
A fluffy dog toy for kids. Looks almost like new. Amelia has always loved dogs. She’ll be delighted to have it.
I hope you'll come back.
Bandits keep threatening me. I need a gun to keep them away.
I've got nothing, only a toy. The last one.
Please, man! I need a gun.
So, how's it gonna be?
I can trade it to you. For a gun.
What's that? A fucking plush dog?
Maybe there's something inside!
Nothing... Useless shit!
How you enter here?! What are you looking for?
This is very common, a symbolic contribution would be enough.
This? Surprisingly, we acquire it quite easily.
You would have to offer us significant help.
Oh, you need to make an extraordinary donation to receive it.
This is something you wish to donate to the hospital...? Really?
We can accept it, but we'd prefer medications or bandages.
We won't need that.
This will be useful for our patients.
Exactly what we need. If you donate it, we can save more lives.
Don't be ridiculous. Offer us something useful or leave.
If you're into this kind of trade, you've come to a wrong place. Offer us more.
Sure, it's an honest exchange. Not necessarily an expected donation...
That's an offer I'd expect from a decent person!
It'd be such a generous donation... I hope you won't change your mind.
Where is my gun?
I only need a gun.
You want this toy, right?
Please, I need a gun to protect myself!
You wat to get this toy?
All right! Thank you!
I'll feel safer now.
Everyone should choose one happy memory. And it can’t just be good, it has to be grand. When it gets so bad you just want to sit down and cry, when your life seems forfeit, you close your eyes and go back to your happy moment. It’s not easy, but you have to try.
My father told me that I should choose one happy memory. And when the life becomes miserable, I just have to close my eyes and go back to that happy moment. But what do you do when your happiest memory brings you nothing but pain?
We were called to a tenement fire. I was still the new one on our team. We just started assembling the hoses, when a resident shouted that there was someone inside. I donned the mask, went in and carried out a young lady. Long story short, we got married soon after. Her name was Alina.
My happiest moment is a memory of a fire. I was a new addition to our team and guys used to tease me, calling me names, but it was a friendly ribbing. Long story short, we were called to a tenement fire and I got lucky, rescued a young lady and became the old hand right there. And that lady, Alina was her name, became my wife soon after.
Alina gave me two beautiful girls. We were so happy. When the war broke out, we decided they would be safer at my mother’s house in the country. I stayed with my team to help people. We thought all this would be over in a couple of weeks. It’s been almost three years now. Phones are dead, so I’ve been sending letters through anyone leaving the city.
We had two kids, two beautiful daughters. When the war started, she took them and moved to the country, to my mother. She wanted me to come but I’d never leave my team in times like these. We had a lot of fires to fight. Then, there were more fires than we could fight... and later on the team was no more. It turned out I couldn’t leave the city.
I’ve got no reply yet and I’m really worried. But I have to trust that Alina and the girls are fine and that everything is going to be alright, or I’ll go mad. When this siege is over, I'll find them no matter what and I won't let anything separate us ever again. I hope that one day we can forget this war ever happened and think of it as just a bad dream.
I've had no word from them for months now. There is no way to reach them, no phones, no mail, I’ve tried to give letters to strangers, but haven’t heard back. I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever see my Alina and my daughters alive. And this slowly drives me crazy. I wish I could get my hands on whoever started this madness.
Adam lived to see the end of the fighting, but he failed to learn what really happened to Amelia. He never saw her again.

Adam lived to see the end of the fighting, but he failed to learn what really happened to Amelia. He never saw her again.
Adam died before he managed to learn the truth about what happened to Amelia.
It was a tough decision but there were reasons why Marko could not stay in the shelter.
Marko slipped out of the shelter one night, leaving no notes behind. He died, betrayed by a smuggler, while trying to reach his family.
Adam chose what he believed was the quickest way to be with his cdaughter and wife again.
One night, ^CharacterName^ left the shelter taking ^OtherCharacterName^ with {ms|him}{fs|her}. They somehow managed to reach a refugee camp, where they spent the rest of the war.
It feels like just yesterday I buried Barbara, and now Amelia is ill as well. This damn war will not take my daughter away from me. I will not allow it. I'll find a way to save her.
Sorry to disturb you, funny how life turns out. I'm a fireman, I've been saving people all my life. Now I'm the one that needs saving. My family fled to the country. I wanted to go to them, but the city got encircled and I couldn't. Will you let me stay with you?
It’s Marko’s body. He used to save people’s lives and now he lies dead and abandoned. He deserved better.
Adam's family failed to flee the city in time, but they managed to get by somehow despite the siege... Until one day Adam's wife fell ill. Without the proper meds, Barbara died. After her mother's death Amelia became completely withdrawn and stopped speaking. Then she fell ill.</n></n>One night an explosion shook their tenement, but fortunately they survived. Adam carried Amelia to the other wing of the building, desperate to save his daughter.
Adam's daughter
Amelia
Adam
Look at her sleeping. So innocent.
I'd better take Amelia's plush dog. I'm sure she misses it.
She’s so fragile, yet must be so brave.
Not good... Your forehead is burning.
I need to quickly find some meds.
Be strong. Daddy will come back soon.
Don’t worry, munchkin.
I am sure all your friends are okay.
You'll see them as soon as the fighting is over.
Amelia and her plush doggie... Threy're so adorable together.
Yes, I know it’s not fair mommy isn't with us anymore.
But I'm here, and I'm not gonna leave you.
All that matters now is that we have each other.
She looks so peaceful, hugging the plushie.
Meds are hard to come by, my friend.
My poor girl... I love you so much.
I'm coming for you, Amelia.
I need to check out the hospital. Someone took Amelia there.
My sweet munchkin... I hope you'll get well soon.
Hang in there, sweetie. Daddy will soon give you something to eat.
It would be nice to find some kind of a toy for Amelia.
Everything will be alright, Amelia. We'll be safe here. I promise.
I must have blacked out from exhaustion...
Bastard! Did he really take her away?
I can't remember what happened...
Amelia... My precious munchkin... I'm so sorry...
Someone's on the radio? I must try to tune it.
Hello? Can anyone hear me? My child is sick…
My poor baby... I hope she'll be fine.
I need to find something for Amelia.
The radio... I can hear someone talking! I have to check it.
I hope my little daughter is alright.
My poor wife... I miss you so much, Barbara.
Amelia... Amelia? Where are you?
What happened here?
My brother must've taken you! I'll kill him!
It's Amelia's toy... She was here...
Where’s Amelia? I can’t remember a thing from this night. I must have blacked out from exhaustion. Did she go somewhere? Did… did someone take her? I must find my daughter!
This place looks safe enough, but I have to make sure. I need to check all the rooms for food and meds for Amelia, we desperately need them. My poor little girl... I cannot lose her too.
Check out what I found, kiddo. A plush doggie!
Look how cute and cuddly it is.
Why don't you take care of him while daddy takes care of you.
I'm certain to meet armed men. I'd better take some weapon with me.

Open frequency
Pharmacy
My brother's pharmacy. He will probably stop by there on his way to the humanitarian corridor. If Amelia is with him, I might be able to find them there.
My brother's pharmacy... Is Amelia here?
Toy Store
Amelia loved visiting that toy store before the war. Now the soldiers turned it into an 'enhanced' interrogation centre. Apparently they are keeping the unfortunate doctor there. Only he might know where Amelia is... I'd better go there well prepared. I hope it's not too late.
This is where the soldiers are keeping the doctor. He might know where Amelia is.
Old Church
A small, old church near the outskirts of Pogoren. Apparently, the gathering point for those willing to use the humanitarian corridor. Was Amelia evacuated, or is she still there? I have to find out!
So many bodies... Are they the people who came here for the humanitarian corridor?

Oh God, thank you! My sunshine is alive!
I'm sure she's right about the toy store. I'll find a new plush dog there.
I need to get a grip on myself and find that toy.
Soon, my sweetie... I will see you again...
Yes, that old man just wants to survive. I must find a gun for him.
Pull yourself together, man! You have to do it! For your daugther!
I have to try again... I miss them so much!
The people intending to use the humanitarian corridor were massacred. So many bodies...
I managed to save the doctor from those murderers, and he told me to talk to father Damir at the church. He knows where Amelia is. Soon we'll be together again.</n>
The poor doctor was tortured to death... I wanted to help him, but what was I to do?
The humanitarian corridor is to be opened near the church. That's where I'll find Amelia.
I hear that the woman who'd had Amelia's hoodie died. Maybe she'd be alive if I hadn't retrieved it from her... But Barbara had given it to Amelia, and she needs it more.
I retrieved Amelia's hoodie from the woman who'd had it. It breaks my heart to know my poor girl is out there, shivering from cold! How can anyone be so callous as to rob a sick child of her hoodie!?
When I got to the hospital Amelia had already been taken somewhere else. I must talk to that doctor before those soldiers kill him, or I may never find her!</n>
My brother must've taken Amelia, and is planning to escape with her via the humanitarian corridor. He'll visit his pharmacy and take what he can before going to the rally point. I must catch them at the pharmacy!
I can’t leave Amelia on her own. What if someone comes into our shelter? I need to protect her.
You again? So, did you get a gun for me?
Damn this war...
Amelia looked so happy when I gave her the plushie. The smile on her face melts my heart. I wish she had more reasons to smile, but in these circumstances...
No, I can't waste time, Amelia needs me.
Oh no... It is Amelia's plush doggie... torn in half. What I will tell her? She will be so sad... Shit..</n></n> It's all broken. I can't take it. That is so bad..
I need to get to the other wing of the tenement. I suppose I could build a makeshift bridge here.
Something terrible happened.

Taking care of Amelia
I found a plush doggie and gave it to my daughter, hoping she will get better soon.
Amelia disappeared!
I woke up and Amelia was gone. Was she kidnapped?! I couldn't remember anything. I must've fallen asleep.
The unwanted memories of that fatal night came rushing back. Amelia hadn't been kidnapped after all. I'd tried to save her, but failed. Unable to accept it, I lived in denial... Until now.
I remembered
No signs of struggle. She knew the person who took her...
Mud tracks all over the floor... Whoever was here, must have crossed through fresh soil. Or maybe marsh?
What happened here? It's a complete mess. Broken furniture, mud all over the floor...
Footprints of a grown man... My brother really did this! I need to pay him a visit.
It's all clear now. I buried my daughter beside her mom... It was the hardest things I did, but I had to do it. Then I pushed it out of my mind. It's time to choose. Shall I join my familly? Be with my wife and child again?
A civilian shot in the back of the head. It was clearly an execution.
We'll help you. You're gonna be okay.
O my God, they killed him... I could've saved him...
Amelia... I... Oh God this can't be...
I... I promised... I failed...
That greedy old bastard! He knows something but won't tell me for free! I'll give him what he wants, finding Amelia is the only thing that matters now. </n>
I failed to protect my girls...
I'm... I'm sorry, my sweetie.
I can't do it. I must carry on.
You are with mom now.
Someday we'll be together again...
Poor Amelia... I need to find my daughter!
Radio is making weird noises. I need to check it.
Facing the truth
I need help. Someone please, answer me!
I'll be close, don't worry. I'll check on you soon. You should rest now.
Makeshift bridge
A makeshift bridge leading to the other wing of the house.
Days of watching over Amelia without rest have taken their toll. Adam passed out from exhaustion. When he regained consciousness, he realised that the bed was empty. Amelia was nowhere to be found.
This door looks barred solid… I don’t think anyone could get through it.
Unresponsive
Amelia has always been a quiet child, who preferred drawing and daydreaming from playing with her friends. However, since her mother's death she stopped speaking at all, only nodding or shaking her head when daddy asks her something. She has fallen ill, and is in dire need of meds.
Everything points to the pharmacy. I need to check it out.
Te dziwne dźwięki z radia.. ktoś próbuje się ze mna skontaktowac?
I love you, Amelia.
The trail leads to the hospital.
Amelia... My precious munchkin... I'm so sorry...
Musze porozmawiac z ksiedzem.
What happened that night?
I love you, Amelia. Be strong.
I'm sorry, Barbara...
I failed to protect my girls...
I must find my daughter!
There's no time to waste. I need to find her.
Brother... If that's your doing, you went too far this time.
The radio... Amelia...
I have to go to the pharmacy!
Sorry? Where... Where's my husband? What did you do?!
Such a nice doll. Pity it's been damaged. Amelia would surely like it...
On the pile of documents there's a note from the headquarters:</n></n>"The insurgents will be trying to flee the city via the humanitarian corridor. They will be trying to pass for civilians, i.e. parents with children. Don't get fooled. Deal with them them accordingly."
I hope my little daughter is fine.
I'm off for a smoke.
Hey my girls..
I miss you so much..
I hope you two are happy there..
Love you..
A pile of letters. None from people I know. Some mention the humanitarian corridor...</n></n>Maybe I'll find something that can lead me to where he took Amelia.
No footprints.. Amelia can't get here..
You've learned the truth about Amelia's fate.
Victims of war often suffer from mental disorders.
There was one big mess in the pharmacy, as if someone was looking for something in a hurry. Whoever it was, I hope they didn't hurt Amelia.
What luck, a plushie! And it looks almost like new. Amelia will be so happy!
Amelia's toy. She loved it and would never just leave it here. What happened? Was she kidnapped?
|#color=D16619|Nina - Adam, jesteś?</n>|#color=541400|Adam - Tak.</n>|#color=D16619|Nina - Co się z Tobą dzieje?</n>|#color=541400|Adam - Nie wiem.</n>|#color=D16619|Nina - Przeszukales caly sklep?</n>|#color=541400|Adam - Nie, czesc jest zamknieta i niedostepna.</n>|#color=D16619|Nina - Musisz jakos sie tam dostac.

Thank you. I need to hurry there.
The humanitarian corridor was supposed to start there.
Strange sounds coming from radio.
New entry in Adam's bio.
I can't recall what happened last night.
And what happened with my daughter.
What's that?!
Odd sounds from the radio. I need to check it!
Hello again.
Hi stranger.
Amelia and her love of drawing... Even when we can't find crayons, she still finds a way...
Maybe I could find something for my daughter in here.
I need to get to the other part of the building
This makeshift bridge will help me reach the shelled part of the building.
|#color=D16619|Femele voice - ...do you read me?</n>|#color=541400|Adam - Hello? Yes... Who are you?</n>|#color=D16619|Femele voice - I got your messages over the radio.

Pharmacy... I need to check it out. Is Amelia alright? My poor child...
I love you, my brave little girl.
Her forehead is burning. I need to find some meds.
Amelia!
Is everything ok with Amelia? I have to check.
Damn this war… No child should have to go though all this horror.
Makeshift bridge main part
This part is required to build the makeshift bridge.
This is a perfect place to build a makeshift bridge. It could help me reach my old apartment. Maybe something can still be salvaged after the bombing.
Locked door… Maybe there’s food on the other side. Or meds! Hang on, Amelia.
Sweetie, I brought some meds. Everything will be alright now.
The fever will drop soon, I promise.
Don’t spit it out. I know it tastes awful, but it'll make you feel better.
Look, munchkin. I found some food.
I know you’re sick and don’t feel like eating… but you need to eat to be strong.
Yes, that’s my girl. Eat it all, you will feel better soon.
Who told you that? What's your connection to him?
I can use this part to build a makeshift bridge.
Please rest now, you need to regain your strength.
I will look around the house, see what I can find.
Food! Even some vegetables! I could make a warm soup for Amelia. Like Barbara always did...
It's dirty, but it definitely is the Plush Doggie I gave to Amelia.
Anyone? Please, anyone, respond…
My daughter is very sick. We need bandages and meds…
Filthy Plush Dog
To anyone who might hear this. My daughter is missing.
Her name is Amelia. She was wearing a white hoodie and grey trousers.
She is very sick. Please help.
My brother's house. Did he take Amelia there? I have to find out before his recklessness gets her killed.
It looks abandoned, but I'd better check thoroughly. Amelia might still be here.
They say some people still live there, against all odds. Maybe they've seen Amelia. Or at least know something. They must have some supplies stocked, like canned food and possibly bandages or medicines, but they won't want to trade. If Amelia ever needs those, I'll have to steal.
Empty at this moment.
The trail from the pharmacy leads either to the gas station or there. Amelia used to go to that school. I've heard rumors that now it's overrun by the homeless. Maybe they've seen or heard something?
Maybe the homeless dwelling here know something about Amelia. I should ask them.
The supermarket area remains under military control, but people from all parts of the city are still trying to scavenge it for supplies. If I manage to meet some of them, they might help me locate Amelia. Some doors might still be locked, a crowbar could come in handy.
People from all over town come here. Maybe someone saw Amelia. I have to ask around.
I remember going to the city center when Amelia was little. It used to be so beautiful, with parks, squares and monuments, surrounded by old buildings. Just before the war, she wanted to go there again, but I was too busy with work... Now, numerous incidents with civilians shot out there earned it the nickname: 'Sniper Junction'. I hope she didn't wander in there.
It's so dangerous here. I hope she didn't come here, but I have to be sure.
This old apartment building is owned by an elderly couple and their son. They are still around, somehow managing to fend off looters. Could they be the ones that took Amelia? Will they give her back without a fight? Lock picks might come in handy.
Empty at this moment.
The bum from the school pointed me here. Apparently someone carried Amelia towards this hospital. I heard it's been bombed recently. My innocent girl... I hope she's alright.
No bandits... The hospital seems to be open. Amelia... I hope you're alright.
St. Mary's Church is known for its charitable priest, Olek. The group for humanitarian corridor was gathering there. If there's anywhere they could send Amelia from the hospital, it's this church.
Empty at this moment.
If I wanted to get laid for a can of meat, this is the place. Mothers will do some really kinky stuff to get food for their children. It's a big building, well guarded by local thugs. They have plenty of goods and are eager to trade. Maybe I can get a weapon there.
Empty at this moment.
This used to be a warehouse of a big store. Currently it's used as a hideout by a group of armed thugs. It's very dangerous, but I might find a weapon there.
Empty at this moment.
Half of it is a ruin, but there are people living in the other half. Apparently, they aren't hostile and have a lot of stuff to barter, even food and meds. I need to remember to take something to trade if I'm going to pay them a visit.
Empty at this moment.
It was supposed to be a luxurious residential area and there was a great hype on apartments there, but the developers fled abroad when the war started. Recently, the military wrested control over this area from the rebels. I could scavenge whatever the rebels left behind, but there is a risk of encountering military patrols.
Empty at this moment.
My daughter is very sick. I need meds.
Oh, you’re the guy from the radio!
Yes! Do you have meds?
Some guy, about your size, was carrying her towards the hospital.
I don't know anything, man.
Feel free to ask around though, maybe somebody knows something.
The hospital... You'd better be right. For your own sake.
I beg you… She’s all I have.
Alright, I’ll do what I can. But I can't promise anything, I nearly got shot on my way here.
Hey, I've brought those meds you wanted! Let's trade!
It cost me an arm and a leg, but I have those meds you asked for.
Crayons
A colorful set of crayons. It’s almost complete. Amelia could draw whatever she wanted with them.
People are taken there for interrogation. I wouldn't go there if I were you, though. It's suicide.
Is that so? Lemme guess, you need her as an excuse to use the humanitarian corridor.
I beg your pardon? She's very ill, I need to find her.
So much destruction after the bombing... will we ever be able to rebuid?
I'm looking for my kidnapped daughter, maybe you've seen her?
I think I saw her a couple of days ago with you, but since then... no.
It must've been the kidnappers... I need to use the radio, maybe someone knows something...
Oh my God... My poor darling daughter...
Excuse me, this hoodie over there belongs to my daughter.
How did you get it? Have you seen my child?
The safe is busted open. It was clearly a robbery.
Med wrappers, syringes, bandages... Someone was in a hurry, desperately looking for something. What happened here?
Hey, have you seen a ten-year-old girl? I'm looking for my daughter.
No. I'm sorry for your loss.
Have you recently been to the pharmacy? My daughter was there, maybe you saw where she went?
Where we've been is none of your business... Now, fuck off!
I could tell you, but I'm so hungry...
Oh my God! Really? Please, tell me everything you know!
I'm looking for my missing daughter. A little blonde girl.
Oh yeah, I've seen her...
I haven’t seen any kids around, sorry man.
I’m looking for my daughter. She went missing.
A girl… About this tall… Have you seen her?
What are you talking about, man?
What happened here? What a mess! Bandages, needles and... a plushie?
Everything in disarray... Was this place burgled? Fuck!
What's this under the sheets?
Oh no... It is Amelia body? </n></n>No... it's not.. Thank God.</n>
Amelia! Amelia!
There's a letter on the desk:</n></n>"Mira, I've hidden some meds in the cabinet. I hope they'll be of use to you and your sick husband. If they are not enough, there's a Pharmacy to the south of here - you might still find medical supplies there, but be careful. I've heard some dangerous people like to come there.</n></n>And don't worry about me - a man offered to smuggle me out of the city and I am going to take this opportunity. Be well.</n></n>Your loving sister,</n>Erika"</n>
A Pharmacy to the south... Dangerous people... What if they took Amelia? No, I mustn't think this way... But I should still check it out.
To anyone who might hear this. Please...
Her name is Amelia... She is my daughter...
I'm looking for her... Please someone... do something... help...
Someone killed my brother and kidnapped Amelia. The clues point towards the school or the gas station...
Amelia... I'm so sorry... I will find you, I promise.
Amelia would never leave her plushie behind, someone must have kidnapped her.
I need to keep looking. The school and the gas station are my best bets now.
I am looking for my missing daughter, Amelia.
I think she might have been kidnapped.
I failed to protect her...
I have to keep looking, I have to find her.
Amelia was at the pharmacy, but where was she taken from there?
How can anyone kidnap a sick, helpless child?
I hope my little girl is okay.
Amelia... Where are you my Amelia?
The trail leads either to the gas station or the school... But where should I go first? It might be my only chance of finding Amelia!
Ten radiowy komunikat.. muszę ruszyc jego śladem.
Apteka to mój pierwszy trop.
Muszę udac się do Apteki i sprawdzic czy Amelka tam była.
Ktoś próbuje mi pomóc.. muszę iśc do tej apteki.
If anyone has seen her, I beg you, respond.
She's 10 years old and wearing a white hoodie.
Scena 3 - cmentarz (opcjonalnie, jeśli się wyrobimy):</n></n>Adam łkajac kopie grób.</n></n>Koniec flashbacku, wracamy do Adama klęczącego na grobie Amelii, kładącego na nim znaleziona w aptece zabawkę i ściskajacego w ręce pistolet.</n></n>Fade to black. End game.
Who are you? Where's my husband?
Scena 2 - apteka:</n></n>Adam klęczy na podłodze w aptece, gdzie znaleźliśmy zabawkę Amelki. Próbuje podac jej leki / dac jej zastrzyk: "Amelia, please wake up. Please don't leave me. Don't... Please... No..." Po chwili zaczyna łkac, tulac swoje nieżywe dziecko. Pojawia się nad nimi ikona akcji "Pochowaj". Gracz musi w nia kliknac. Po kliknięciu, gracz widzi, jak Adam wstaje. Amelce wypada z ręki zabawka. Adam wolnym, smutnym krokiem wynosi Amelkę z apteki.
Podczas zakończenia, gdy Adam odnajdzie grób Amelki, pojawi się flashback:</n></n>Scena 1 - shelter:</n>Adam orientuje się, że Amelka nie oddycha. Próbuje ja ocucic: "Amelia, Amelia! Oh my God! I need to do something!". Bierze Amelkę na ręce i wybiega z pokoju.</n>
I... I'm not gonna hurt you. I am just looking for my daughter.
Your daughter?
Her name is Amelia. She's ten. Wore a white hoodie. Have you seen her anywhere?
I think... I think I saw someone carrying her. They went in that direction.
Thank you and... I'm sorry.
Shhh, sweetie, don't cry.
You need changing... Your daddy always vanishes somewhere when you need changing.
Oh my soweet baby... Either the bombsings wake me or you do.
Let this war be over soon...
What do you want? There is nothing here, get lost!
Last warning. Fuck off.
Please be careful. They might be armed.
Get out of here while you still can.
I need to get inside. Don't stand in my way.
Muddy footprints of a grown man. Someone's been here recently... Or still is.
It's my brother's body! Looks like he was stabbed to death!</n></n>No signs of Amelia... Did someone take her? Where to? I must find out!
A colorful set of crayons. It’s almost complete. Amelia could draw whatever she wanted with them.
If I could only find some crayons... It would take her mind off our troubles.
She loved to draw even before she learned to talk.
What’s that, kiddo? You want to draw?
I’ll try to find you some crayons.
You draw such pretty pictures.
Are you the one I heard on the radio? Are you looking for your daughter?
Yes! Do you know something?
I know how you feel. My children are missing too.
I've heard rumors of child traffickers around the Toy Store, but was too terrified to go there myself.
You think our kids might be kept there?
I don't know... But I went there one night and heard a child crying.
I don't know if that old man was telling the truth, but it's the only clue I've got. It seems I have no choice but to look for Amelia at the hospital and hope she's alright.
Adam?! Jestes tam?
Good! I’ll come to pick you up in a few days. Until then, be safe, my friend!
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
Przychodze w sprawie twojego komunikatu radiowego!
Jest tam kto? Przyszlam porozmawiac o twojej corce.
Slyszalam twoje nawolywanie w radiu odnosnie corki.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Halo, jest tam ktos?
Mozemy pogadac? Mozliwe ze wiem cos na temat twojej corki..
Chcialabym porozmawiac o porywaczach...
Gosciu jest podejrzany.
Nie podoba mi sie ten facet.
Placze? Nie, chyba nie.
Musze pilnowac budynku zeby nikt nie przeszkadzal.
Jak my damy rade?
Ze tez teraz to dziecko sie przytrafilo...
I found my brother's body in the pharmacy. I never thought his death would shake me so much. Amelia wasn't with him. Who could've taken her? And where to? I hope she's alright.
Crayons. So many colors. Amelia will be so happy I found them. Amelia… Where are you?
Probably... I... I sent most of my patients there...
Muśż iść do tej willi.
Muszę się tam udać.
Muszę dalej szukac. Znaleźc tych bandytów.
Udało mi sie zdobyc jakiś ślad w sklepie z zabawkami, muszę go sprawdzić.
Cholerni bandyci porwali moje dziecko.. Amelia już niedługo...
I hope my little daughter is fine.
No, sorry. But ask the others, maybe they know something.
I need to check his pharmacy.
Did my idiot brother take Amelia to his pharmacy?
The letter points to the pharmacy. I need to go there.
I will go there and see for myself. Thank you.
I'm looking for my daughter. Have you seen a little girl around?
W tej willi moga byc bandyci. Muszę się przygotowac.
This place... I've been here before... Oh no...
Oh God... My munchkin...
Oh my God... I think... I think I remember...
Thanks goodness, finally some meds for Amelia! I pray they help. Still, I need to get more as soon as possible.
I'm so glad I found some food for Amelia! My heart breaks when she's hungry. I must set out to find more as soon as the worst fighting stops.
Finally, some food! I can make Amelia something to eat now.
LOOK FOR AMELIA
LOOK FOR AMELIA|XPadX|
There's a letter on the floor:</n></n>"Adam, even though things have never been great between us, we're still brothers. You were too proud to come live at my house when yours was destroyed, at least be reasonable now!</n></n>There have been talks of a humanitarian corridor opening soon, and people with children are prioritized. Amelia is our chance for getting out of here. Don't you wan't to save her?".
I completely forgot about this letter. My damn brother...
You took your sweet time... Can we talk?
Good! I’ll come to pick you up in a few days. Until then, be safe, my friend!
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
Adam, we need to talk!
Adam, I know you're in there! Open the door!
Adam, for goodness' sake!
Adam, let's talk.
Can we talk, brother?
Good to see you, brother. Can we talk?
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
I just wanna talk, brother. Open the goddamn door.
Adam... Hear me out, please.
Not you again... I told you already...
Adam, grab Amelia and let's go. She's our ticket out of here.
This humanitarian corridor I told you about... We're in luck, brother! They prioritize parents with children!
She's not your ticket. She's my daughter. And there's no way she'd survive that in her current state.
I'd have to carry her and make frequent stops. They'd kill us before we get anywhere.
Always a pessimist. I'm sure she'll make it! And she's our only chance out of this hell!
Listen to yourself, willing to risk her life like that.
I just want to get us out of here, man. Don't you want it too, and for Amelia to be safe?
If you're too scared, I can take her myself!
Under the pressure from the international community the Graznavian government forces are going to open a temporary humanitarian corridor for the civilians in the besieged city of Pogoren. The exact date and location have not yet been disclosed. We'll share more details as soon as we learn them.
Anyone home? Brother?
Amelia? Are you here?
What a mess... What are these documents?
There's something on the other pile. I'd better have a look.
Humanitarian corridor... Yeah, right. He's just getting in trouble... Again.
My brother was born an asshole and will die an asshole.
When he comes by, I'll tell him what I think of his dumb ideas.
Listen to me carefully. You touch her, I'll kill you.
There's a letter on the floor:</n></n>"We're doing it tonight. The government forces have finally listened to the UN and are opening the corridor. Road DL-1 is supposed to be safe for 24 hours. We can finally get out of this hellhole. You know the meeting place.</n></n>G.</n></n>P.S. Please make sure to stop by your pharmacy on the way. We need all the meds and bandages we can get. We have many sick and wounded, including children."
They were headed towards the pharmacy... Alright.
A man's footprints. Was it my brother?
More footprints and more blood. The trail leads to the back alley...
The trail of blood leads down the alley, towards the gas station and Amelia's school.</n></n>The gas station is located by the road that leads out of the city. The soldiers don't let anyone out, but if someone passed as a parent of a dying child... Who knows?</n></n>The school is closed now, but I've heard that some people moved there after the shellings. Could one of them have abducted Amelia?
Brother?! What happened?! Where's Amelia?!
My brother... He's dead... What happened here? Where is Amelia?
Amelia is in danger. I need to follow the trail.
There's something on the floor... a bunch of keys! And the safe is opened.
Fuck! Is that my brother?! Where's Amelia?!
That's odd... My brother never lets go of these keys.
The safe has been busted open. All the valuables are gone.
Pek kluczy brata Adama. Jest w nim nawet pamiatkowy bryloczek, ktory kiedys podarowal mu Adam.
Lots of mud and fresh footprints. There must be quite a lot of people living here.
Med packages in large quantities. Lots of dirty bandages. How could they have hoarded so many?
Our home... Everything lost...
Could they be the ones who robbed my brother's pharmacy?!
If Amelia hasn't left the city, she must be at the church.
ADAM DAJE JEDZENIE - QUEST COMPLETED
Here's your food, you greedy bastard. Now spill it.
No need to be rude. There isn't much to tell. I've recently seen a girl, maybe 10 years old. She fit your description.
I'm looking for my missing daughter. I heard rumors she'd been brought here.
Bring me the food. I'll wait here.
He won't be in any condition to talk, even if they let him out. Which I strongly doubt.
I'm looking for my daughter and he might know where she is. I must talk to him.
Please... Tell me she didn't die in the massacre...
Bullshit. The whole hospital was a front for them!
*cough* I... don't know... anything... about the insurgents...
I was just... helping people!
Stop lying! You were helping rebels!
Ugh... how can you... look at yourself in the mirror?
Still talking back? Haven't had enough yet?
Murderers...You've shelled the hospital... Killed all those innocent people...
Collateral damage. Maybe you shouldn't have treated insurgents.
Women... Children... All of them dead...
I... I'll tell you... Just... don't hit me... anymore...
Where are the survivors? Where did you send them?
The church... People were gathering there... for the humanitarian corridor...
For many... it was the last chance... especially for the sick children...
Spill it!
Someone knew that the massacre would happen, but didn't warn the people... Bastard!
Let's wrap this up. He's of no use to us anymore.
No! I beg you... I told you everything... The patients need my help!
They'll have to get by without you.
No, please... Don't hurt me anymore!
Relax, you're safe now. My daughter, Amelia, was brought to your hospital, where is she now?
Thank you... I thought I was done for...
I... I don't remember anything... They've kept me here so long...
Where is she?! Was she taken to the humanitarian corridor?
I don't see any soldiers yet, but I must be careful.
We need blood... lots of blood as soon as possible.
Hold on... You will make it. I promise.
More bodies... Someone rounded up these people and killed them in cold blood... It was a massacre.
Are you alright? Thank God.
Damn murderers... We need help!
So many wounded...
Don't just stand there, do something!
We need blood. Lots of it!
God help us...
Excuse me, Father. I'm looking for my daughter, Amelia.
But, I can tell that you're deperate, so... There's an abandoned toy store nearby.
She didn't...
Thanks goodness! Is she here?
She is, you can go to her. My prayers are with her.
Oh, you can even kill me, but who will tell you where your daughter is, mister Angry Father?
I need to ask around. Someone must have seen something.
There's a hoodie on the bed. It looks remarkably like the one Amelia was wearing... I'm pretty sure it's the same one!</n></n>It used to be her mother's... How did this woman come to have it? I must ask her!
Want to save her? Bring me the food. I'll wait here.
Bring me food.
I want food in exchange for information. I prefer canned food, but raw food will do in a pinch. See how generous I am?
Some guy, about your size, was carrying her towards the hospital.
I'm looking for my missing daughter. A little blonde girl.
Oh yeah, I've seen her...
Oh my God! Really? Please, tell me everything you know!
You help me first, then I help you. I'm very hungry...
If you bring me some food, I'll tell you what I know.
The hospital... You'd better be right. For your own sake.
How about you tell me now and I don't kick the shit out of you?
Oh, I won't tell you anything if you hurt me. And if you kill me, you'll never find your daughter.
No need to be rude. There isn't much to tell. I've seen a blonde girl, maybe ten years old.
Here's your food, you greedy bastard. Now spill it.
The footprints lead upstairs. There are bloodstains too.
Whoever it was, they must have turned around towards the back alley door.
The door is unlocked and there's blood on the door handle. I need to check the back alley.
I hope I can talk to that doctor before it's too late.
It's been so long... Will Amelia still be at the church?
Everything points to the church.
The doctor taken by the soldiers is my only shot at finding Amelia...
I need to go to the toy store.
Say... I'll tell you what I know if you bring me some food, alright?
How about you tell me now and I don't kick the shit out of you?
Brother's house
Ruined Block of Flats
Some of my good friends used to live in this neighborhood. If they're still around, maybe they know something about Amelia.
Looted Gas Station
This gas station has already been looted, but the trail led to either school or there. Maybe Amelia's captor is trying to leave the city that way. Can I still catch up to them?
The church! That's where the doctor was sending children!
Brother's Pharmacy keys
My brother has always kept his keys on him, it's strange that they were lying on the ground. I can use them to open locked doors in the pharmacy.
Brother! Amelia! Are you here?!
Receiving!
Get out of here while you still can!
I need to get inside. Don't stand in my way.
Last warning. Get the fuck out of here or die.
Yes sir, we've got him!
Yes, the boys are working on him as we speak... He'll talk.
Understood. We'll dispose of him afterwards.
Over and out!
They're not here... Damn it! Maybe there are clues to their wherebouts in those papers.
Locked...This is where my brother stores his gun. He probably has the keys on him.
No gun... He must have taken it.
You don't understand, she's very ill! If you know something, you must tell me!
You got hearing problems? I said fuck off!
Have you seen a man with a ten-year-old girl? She's my daughter.
Haven't seen any kids in a while...
But I've seen some soldiers.
Them bastards are worse than bandits...
Bloody rapists and murderers. Pray it's not them that got your kid...
She is very ill... they wouldn't hurt an ill child, would they?
A pile of papers. All rubbish, except for a note that mentions the humanitarian corridor:</n></n>"We need to flee the city somehow, and soon. I've learned of a humanitarian corridor to be opened in a couple of days, for the wounded and children. To use it we need to either get seriously wounded... or have some children with us.</n>I'm sure you understand which option I prefer."
Kidnapping a child as a pass to flee the city? Oh God...
Excuse me ma'm, I'm looking for my daughter. Have you seen her?
What? A child...? Oh my God...
What happened?! Do you know something? You must tell me!
My own child was taken away from me... My poor boy, he was only seven...
She's gone.
Now he's gone... Why did you remind me of him?! Why can't I just forget what happened?! Leave me alone!
A large photo of Adam and his family. There's his wife and daughter, their parents and his brother. Someone clearly tried to scratch out his brother from the photo.
Partially burned Adam's diary. The surviving entries read:</n></n>"I buried Barbara today. It's just the two of us now. We kept her hoodie and Amelia wears it all the time. She believes it will protect her from harm. </n></n>Could I have saved Barbara if I had kept in touch with my brother? No, I know him all too well. He'd never share meds with us. Filthy speculator, he'll take advantage of other people's misery to get rich."
Life's so hard without her...
God...
Excuse me? I haven't seen any children in a while.
The hoodie is mine now, finders keepers.
Where did you find it?
It was lying on the floor in that room, behind the hole.
But you won't find anything there, a part of the celiling has collapsed during the bombing.
Not much left here... Wait, there's something! Partially burned hospital documents, I should have a look.
Amelia was here... The doctor must know something. I need to find him!
Can I have it back, please?
Some numbers next to names... I don't know what the numbers mean, but... Amelia's name is mentioned.</n></n>She's been here!</n></n></n></n>
Excuse me, this hoodie over there belongs to my daughter.
How did you get it?
I got it from a nurse. Ask her if you don't believe me.
The nights are very cold here, especially now after the bombing.
I'll have the hoodie back. My daughter must miss it.
I haven't seen your daughter, I got it from a nurse!
And I'm not giving it back, it keeps me warm!
Leave me alone!
The woman from the second floor told me you gave her a hoodie.
As a matter of fact, it belongs to my daughter. Do you know where she is?
Oh... We've had some children here...
Maybe doctor Jefimow could help you... But last night he was taken by the soldiers.
Do you know where they took him?
The security guard by the entrance might know.
As to the hoodie... I've found it discarded on the second floor.
I'd appreciate if you didn't take it. We're very short on blankets and warm clothes.
I hear you might know where the doctor was taken?
I'm looking for my daughter. A short blonde. Have you seen her?
Yeah, right. You're not the first rebel to try to flee the city in the guise of an innocent parent.
I can tell you have blood on your hands. Don't try anything, I've got my eye on you!
I haven't given up on her! I'll save her!
I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were you. Not with all the soldiers around.
Look! They tortured me! Mutilated!
Bloody bastards! I hope they rot in the ground before all this is over.
Amelia's Hoodie
Well-worn and dirty, but it undoubtedly is Amelia's hoodie.
The hoodie on that woman's bed looks familiar...
Excuse me, where's the lady who was recently lying here?
She died.
What happened?
We're undersupplied, and she was sick and wounded. The constant draught doesn't help either.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Such tragedy... I've lost my hospital... I've lost everything...
I was lucky, but my patients were not...
*sigh*
What am I supposed to do now...?
You... Thank you for saving my life.
I did what I had to. I'm looking for my daughter, Amelia. She was at your hospital.
All the children from the hospital were sent to the church.
My fool of a brother can get himself killed if he wants to, but I won't risk Amelia's life by carrying her through the middle of the warzone. We'll find the corridor when the worst fighting is over.
Did someone kidnap Amelia to justify using the humanitarian corridor? If so, at least they won't hurt her, will they?
Can't wait till we liberate this city and go home.
It's bloody business. We don't get paid enough.
I wish I were somewhere else. Fucking insurgents.
I hate guard duty.
An anonymous letter:</n></n>"I've got tipped that the soldiers aren't going to let anyone out of the city. The humanitarian corridor is a set up. They're going to kill everyone and blame it on the rebels. Warn whoever you can."
Excuse me, I have a question...
Please come back later.
I'm the only nurse left after the bombing...
I have to tend to this patient.
Please, let me keep it. I'm very weak, even a minor infection can kill me.
It's so empty here after the bombing...
I am so weak...
I would love to see my children one more time...
I haven't been here before, that must've been her captor!
Oh my, poor girl... I hope you find her.
Do you know where he took her?
No, I'm sorry. I really wish I could help you.
Some of my good friends used to live in this neighborhood. It's a big building, I might find some food or other useful supplies there.
My brother's house. When was the last time I visited him there? I don't remember. Nor do I care. If I never see him again, it will be too soon.
The clues point to the school and gas station. I need to go there.
Click YES to start a new game. Click NO to continue from the last day before you died.
I can't waste my time on sleep.
Amelia, my poor baby... I'll sleep later.
No time to sleep now.
I'll rest when I'm dead.
Scattered photos of Adam, Barbara and Amelia. It's clear that they were very happy together.
Lemme check the ammo.
Enough of this trudging.
How long till I get promoted? Or at least reassigned!
These bloody insurgents are everywhere. The city's crawling with them.
Where are my smokes?!
If I were in the high command, this war would long be over.
The ammo's secured, I really hope that transport's coming for us soon.
I'm so fucking bored.
I need to get drunk. Wish I were back at the barracks.
Alright...
Attention!
A letter that reads:</n></n>"Darling, I don't know If I'll see you again, so I'm writing you this letter. The plane was about to take off, but the military stopped all flights. I hear shots, there's panic all around. Gotta finish now,</n></n>I love you</n>J."
I used to work at the airport before the war broke out. Now it's held by the military and off limits to civilians. I'd better keep away, unless I have no choice.
The airport is currently held by the military and off limits to civilians. I don't think Amelia's there, but maybe I could get a gun from one of the soldiers... It's better to have one and not need it, than to need it and not have one.
Excuse me, I'm looking for my daughter. A tiny tween blonde. Have you seen her around?
No, I'm certain I haven't seen her.
Are you sure? I thought someone might have brought her here.
I'm sure. But since you're here, we could trade - I have some really good stuff.
Let's see if I can find something interesting here.
Maybe there'll be something useful here.
This spot looks promising.
I miss my home.
There's a letter in doctor's gown's pocket:</n></n>"Dear friends and colleagues. We have a dire shortage of everything, from meds through bandages to provisions and beds. The humanitarian corridor might be the only chance to save the children and those in serious condition. The randevous point is at the old church. I prey everything goes well.</n></n>Doctor Jefimow"
The doctor was sending children to the church! That's where I must go!
This man might have some information about Amelia.
I don't think that's a good idea.
He might have seen Amelia.
I suspect he knows something.
He might have information about Amelia.
Jedzenie dla Amelki.
Znalazlem dla Amelki troche jedzenia.
Meds for Amelia
I had to trade away almost everything we had, but I managed to get some meds for Amelia.
A ticket out of here
My brother wanted to take Amelia away to help him get through humanitarian corridor. I threw him out.

Brother's body
My brother has been murdered! I found his body on the floor in a pool of blood. We didn't get on well but I never wished him dead. Amelia wasn't there - who took her?!
Dziad chcacy jedzenia za informacje.
Stary dziad chce trzy sztuki jedzenia wzamian za informacje o mojej corce.
Doktor ze szpitala.
Dowiedzialem sie, ze zolnierze zabrali doktora do opuszczonego sklepu z zabawkami.
Retrieved Amelia's hoodie
A woman was using Amelia's hoodie. I took it despite her pleas to let her keep it. Amelia needs it more.
A woman's death
The woman from the hospital died. Amelia's hoodie wouldn't have made the difference, would it?
Murdered doctor
The soldiers tortured and murdered that poor doctor. Could I have saved him?
The massacre
Men, women and children who gathered by the church in hopes of evacuation were massacred in cold blood.
An old hobo told me where to look for Amelia, but not before demanding most of my food. A small price to pay for a clue about my daughter.
Anything for Amelia
Humanitarian corridor
I've learned the location of the humanitarian corridor. I hope to find Amelia there. Maybe she hasn't left the city yet.
Rescued doctor
I managed to save the doctor from those murderers. He told me the location of the humanitarian corridor and said Amelia must have been among the refugees.
Karta medyczna
Znalazlem zniszczona karte medyczna Amelki. To potwierdza, ze musiala byc tutaj. W szpitalu.
Amelia's name was mentioned in the hospital's documents. She's been there.
I shouldn't drink now.
I can't get drunk now. I have to look for Amelia.
I need to be sober, Amelia is still somewhere out there!
Drinking's not a good idea. Amelia needs me.
I can't help Amelia if I'm drunk.
The doctor may know where Amelia is.
There's no point in hurting him.
I need to learn what he knows, first.
This won't accomplish anything.
This woman might know something about Amelia.
I don't think that's a good idea.
She might know something about my daughter.
What if she saw my daughter?

Dissociative amnesia is a memory disorder characterized by sudden retrograde memory loss and is caused by severe stress or trauma, such as that of witnessing the death of a loved one. The person suffering from it forgets the painful experience as if it never happened and lives in denial.

Pickaxe
A military radio - looks new, but recently used. A battery panel is open and the battery is missing. There are binoculars by it, also army-issue.
A box with military markings. There's a battery inside, looks like it'd fit the radio in the shack.
More boxes with army markings, just like those in Novak's son's room.
What’s this? Some kind of a list of names… Most of them look Vyseni, while those that do not have the word ‘sympathiser’ written next to them. Some names have been ominously crossed out… Does this mean that Novak is acting as an informer for the Grazni military? I need to be sure.
A paper… authorizing the bearer to receive provisions at an army base on the outskirts. And a military pass. Novak works for the army!
Watch out, the main alley is under sniper fire! The fucker shot two people already.
I'll try to sprint to the other side. Come with me, we can do it together!
I'll try to get to the other side.
Here's my chance!
Hey! Stop! A sniper!
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
This is C21! Do you hear me?! Over!
My truck broke! I'm stuck with supplies by the petrol station. Requesting assistance! Over!
Shit! Battery's dead.
I must find a new one or I'm as good as dead.
Thank you for telling us about the fuel. We've already burned all our furniture and had no way to cook a meal for our children.
An empty magazine from an army issue assault rifle.
Are you Esma? Wife of Malik? The radio man?
Yes, why?
Oh God… Thank you so much!
My wife was being held prisoner at the Central Square. You saved her life!
How can I repay you?
What brings you here? Is everything all right?
Yes, we're fine. How about you?
I'm… not so well, actually. Not since Velena died.
Oh, I'm so sorry…
I'm coping. I must. For my son. There's only him and me now.

Malik and Esma live in an abandoned broadcasting station, where Malik used to work as a radio host. His wife jokes that the mortar shell which destroyed their house has fulfilled his secret wish: now he doesn't leave work at all.</n>Although war has scattered the radio crew to the four winds, Malik keeps broadcasting the news that Esma gathers during her searches for supplies. The words of truth he can deliver to the people of Pogoren are for him as much a livelihood as the food hard-won by his wife.</n>Their son, Adem, enlisted when the war broke out. They no longer talk about him.
Na poczatkowej cutscenie widac jak Malik siedzi i mowi do radia: "Mieszkancy Pogoren. Przyjaciele. Dlugo juz wspolnie zmagamy sie z tą straszliwa tragedia jaka spadla na nas i nasze miasto. Tylko razem sie wspierajac przetrwamy. I mam nadzieje, ze nasz wspolny wysilek w koncu pojdzie w eter i caly swiat zwroci uwage na nasze cierpienie! Na te straszliwa zbrodnie jakiej dopuscila sie armia! Nie spoczniemy poki nie osiagniemy celu. Ja nie spoczne. Nigdy was nie oklamalem i nie zrobie tego za zadną cene. Chocby grozila mi nawet smierc. Trzymajcie sie, pomagajcie sobie i do uslyszenia wkrotce".
Esma w budynku dalej podglada, ze w zamknietym pomieszczeniu przetrzymywani sa przez zolnierzy jacys ludzie. Prawdopodobnie sa to rebelianci. Podsluchujac rozmowe zolnierzy Esma dowiaduje sie, ze czekaja na przybycie specjalistow od przesluchan (grozba tortur). Chca wydobyc z tych ludzi nazwiska czlonkow ruchu oporu. Esma rowniez slyszy rozmowy tych rzekomych rebelinatow, ktorzy sa przerazeni. Jeden z mezczyzn blaga wrecz o litosc twierdzac, ze w domu zostawil chora zone w ciazy i jesli w niedlugim czasie nie wroci jego Zona umrze.
Lokacje da sie przejsc i zlootowac bo jest on rozlozony, ale scenki nie ma. Ponizej jej opis.</n></n>Esma w budynku spotyka dwoch NPCow, aptekarz i zolnierz. Jest swiadkiem ich kłotni. Zolnierz ostrzega swojego brata (aptekarza, czlonka ruchu oporu) o tym, zeby nie chodzil na spotkania ruchu oporu bo armia w kazdej chwili chce przeprowadzic akcje odwetowa na ich kryjowke. Aptekarz boi sie przekazac te informacje rebeliantom i prosi Esme, aby zrobila to za posrednictwem radia.
Esma na poczatku lokacji zastaje masakre na ludnosci cywilnej. Sporo cial, pozar po wybuchu itd. Sa tez rebelianci fotografujacy ciala i mowiacy, ze trzeba pokazac ta zbrodnie spolecznosci miedzynarodowej bo maja nas w dupie. Spotyka tez czlowieka, ktory probuje przekonac ja, ze jest to prowokacja rebeliantow w celu zwrocenia uwagi spolecznosci miedzynarodowej na fatalna sytuacje w Pogoren. Esma zaczyna rozglądac sie po miejscu zbrodni i za pomoca lupek prowadzi swoje “dochodzenie”, aby dowiedziec sie kto stoi za ta zbrodnia (armia).

This truck is full of supplies we all desperately need. If Malik broadcasts its location, he'll help many people survive!
The main park alley is under sniper fire! I have to tell Malik so he can warn the people.
I’ve discovered that the army is torturing some people suspected of helping the rebels. They'll most likely be killed if they're not rescued soon!
I overheard an argument about an imminent attack on the insurgents. We could warn them, but it might put the pharmacist and his brother in danger. What’s worse, the soldiers could come to our doorstep if they find out we helped the rebels!
I'll ask Malik to warn the rebels about the planned attack on their hideout, so they can move in time. We should do everything in our power to avoid even more bloodshed.
I won’t tell Malik about the attack on the rebels, it’s too risky. The military could get back at us if we spoil their plans! I‘ll just tell Malik about the lack of supplies at the pharmacy.
It’s appalling, but it seems that my old friend is selling people out to the army! I could report him to Malik... but if something happens to him, what will become of his children? I’m sure that if it weren't for them, he would never have done such a horrible thing.
I must tell Malik about Novak’s betrayal. Regardless of the consequences, he should make it public knowledge. If we remain silent, all those people on the list will still be in danger.
What Novak is doing is abhorrent, but if Malik exposes him on the radio, his whole family will be in danger. I’ll tell Malik there’s an informer among us, without revealing his identity.
There was a terrible massacre in the old brewery. Many people waiting for water were killed by mortar shells. The government forces have committed yet another war crime, but spreading this information might put us in grave danger.
All these war crimes can’t go unpunished! We must demand an intervention from the international community. There must be retribution. I’ll tell Malik the truth about the massacre.
The military knows about Malik’s radio. He may be in danger if he spreads the news of their crimes. I’ll tell him this was an accident that the rebels used for propaganda.
Oh, Adem… I hope our son is safe.
People deserve to know the truth. I won't be intimidated.
I miss the times when I could put on music rather than war updates.
The alleged massacre at the old brewery was just an accidental gas explosion after all. It’s very possible that the separatists are trying to capitalize on the death of innocent civilians to garner more support for their cause.
Residents of Pogoren, make sure to avoid St. Timon's Park! It is no longer safe from snipers: several people have already been shot.
Residents of Pogoren, good news! An army truck full of military rations and medical supplies has broken down at the gas station on Maple Street. Get your share before the military reclaims it!
Citizens, bad news today. Unfortunately, the pharmacy near Central Square is severely undersupplied. If you’re in need of medications, you should look elsewhere.
It grieves me to report that someone among us is providing the Grazni military with names of rebel supporters. We do not know his identity yet. If you have any information who it might be, let us know. You will save many lives.
The army is holding and brutally torturing innocent people in a building at Central Square! If anyone who hears this is able to save them, please hurry! There's no time to lose!
Citizens of Pogoren, breaking news! The army is about to hit the rebels’ hideout in Zatom! Pass on this warning to them if you can!
While some people help one another, others care only about themselves. I regret to inform you that Novak, whom we had thought a friend, is collaborating with the military, putting the lives of his neighbours in grave danger.
The army has committed yet another war crime. People were shelled while waiting for water at the old brewery. We once again appeal to the international community for an intervention to end the hostilities.
I need a pickaxe to remove this heap of rubble.
Only a pickaxe can break this rubble.
Even with the pickaxe it's going to take a while.
It's slow-going even with a proper tool.

Due to clashes between the government forces and the separatists, some areas of the city may not be accessible until further notice.
There are intense firefights in multiple districts. Be extra cautious when attepting to move around the city.
The military is expected to attempt another breakthrough. Try to stay off the streets if you can.
The rebel and government forces are engaged in violent skirmishes throughout the city. Some areas have been completely cut off, while others are seeing heavy fighting.
It appears that the clashes between the military and the separatists are going to intensify in the upcoming days.
Current weather forecast: The upcoming days will be getting warmer.
Current weather forecast: overcast throughout the entire South-East Graznavia. It is getting colder every day. Make sure you have enough firewood if central heating is unavailable where you live.
Current weather forecast: the temperature is expected to rise above zero degrees Celsius soon.
We've been informed that in the upcoming days at the old brewery, water will be handed out to those in need of it. Make sure to bring your own containers.
Esma's Death Note.
Their prices are dropping really fast.
Thanks! That's good to know!
Hey, any news?
Yeah. I don't know the source, but cigarettes have gotten really easy to come by.
From what we know, the fighting in the streets is about to become much more violent. Best to stay at home.
Cigarettes and tobacco are still available in Pogoren. How this is possible remains a mystery. Theories include smugglers, corrupt military officials and foreign aid.
Esma did not survive the siege of Pogoren. Another hapless victim of this horrible civil war. She would be missed by everyone who had known her.
Esma couldn’t take it anymore and she left the shelter. She was never heard of again.
Driven to madness by grief, Esma took her own life.
Oh, Esma, hello!
Nice to see you! How's things?
Can you keep an eye on him for a moment?
I'll fetch some food for him.
Sure.
Esma? Where are you?
Shit! I hope she didn't go upstairs!
Mom! I'm back!
Malik's Death Note.
Current weather forecast: the temperature is going to drop below zero degrees Celsius soon.

It looks like some woman lived here.
Oh, God... that's... I don't know the words to describe it.
A scribbled letter reading: "I agree that such a pretty girl would make a valuable asset. Let's make a deal. Bring her to our little establishment and in return you'll get some food, smokes and a free shag once in a while."
A box with some woman's personal belongings.
Thank you! I don't know how much longer I can last!
Hi, Mom.
Open the door, please!
Can we talk? Please answer me. We are waiting.
Hey! Can you help me?!
Hey, people! I need to talk to you!
Can you open the door, please? I have no bad intentions!
Hey, anybody there? I want to talk to you!
I have a child here! You can't just leave us.
I beg you, help us!
Let me in, please!
I'm just looking for shelter, have a heart!
At least hear me out!
We have nowhere to go. Don't leave us!
Will you help us? You won't regret it!
Do you need an extra pair of hands here?
I can be useful, let me stay with you.
We have better chances together, can I stay?
Can I stay here with you? I have nowhere to go…
I have no home left… Maybe I could stay with you here?
Let's go {mr|big guy}{fr|dear}, we cannot give up hope.
We'll try elsewhere.
Alright, I'm out of here.
If you think you're better off without me…
Maybe I'll have better luck elsewhere…
Suit yourself. I'm probably better off without you anyway.
You're leaving me out here to die…
Have you got no heart? It's just a child!
Have you decided yet?
Dad...
Where else are we to go? Please, think it over.
Maybe you can think this through?
Come on, let me stay…
Please, I beg you…
We just need to wait a minute dear.
They just need to discuss it. Don't worry dear, it'll be fine.
Please, make up your mind.
So, what will it be?
Adem
Used batteries scattered on the ground, same type as the others. It seems that Novak uses the radio a lot… What for?
Army gear, here? That's weird.
Another piece of military gear.
This is really suspicious.
A list of names… is he selling them out?
Yes, it seems he is… I need to talk to him. I can't believe this.
Why are you selling people out to the army?
How did you…? I…
I'm so sorry. I hate myself for this.
But it's the only way to provide for my son.
I was informing only on the worst people, or those who had no chance to survive the war anyway…
I never told anyone who is behind the radio broadcasts… and the army is very keen to learn that. Esma, please.
I don't want to tell them about you, you're my friend. Don't make me do it.
I can see a way upstairs.
What the hell happened here?
These people were waiting for water when the shells hit.
Oh my God! There are body parts scattered all over the place! I think I'm gonna throw up...</n></n>There are Vyseni rebels here, taking pictures of everything. It's some kind of nightmare!
Lots of junk and some items made of metal, deformed beyond recognition...
God... If we tell people what actually happened here, the soldiers are bound to seek vengeance.
Fuck it! Fuck the army!
Be careful—those bloody rebels are here.
They're busy making up another "war crime".
What are you talking about?
God dammit. It's terrible.
They must pay for this!
The world needs to know.
They kill civilians to terrorize us.
This is the real face of the army.
Bastards. It's unbelievable.
Oh my God… What the…
Once more!
Move!
Shit!
Mom! I'm so glad to see you! Is Dad all right?
He… They killed him.
No! I'm too late…
They came in the night and shot him. Soldiers like you.
I deserted when I heard that the army is coming after you!
I wanted to warn you…
I’m so sorry for everything. Will you let me in?
Come in… say goodbye to your father.
A bit more potatoes, please, Mommy.
Oh, yes, sure! They're delicious.
Damn, it's surely not safe here.
Soldiers must be close… Damn it.
If he didn't talk in his sleep I'd have took him for dead.
Your radio broadcasts do not go unnoticed by the military, and they’re getting angry.
Do you think we're safe?
It hurts when I try to move… I hope they won't fire again.
If we broadcast the truth about this, we may find ourselves in the hands of a Grazni death squad...
Mom, Dad! It's me, Adem. I'm back.
Are you there? Please open up. You need to get out of here!
Mom! It's so good to see you! I came to warn you.
I deserted, Mom! Please, talk to me.
You have to run, Mom! Please!
Come on, Mom! Open this god damn door!
Mom, please! At least hear me out!
You are in danger! Please, listen to me!
Malik! Malik! What happened here…?
They are here!
Did they come after me?
Bloody bastards!
Bloody rats leave droppings everywhere.
This constant shooting drives me crazy.

I miss the old days...
Where did I put my brush?…
Darling, enough of this! Go and get some news for me!
Radio means the world to me… Esma, please…
I feel terrible about our halted broadcasting.
This war can't end soon enough.
The government is happy to see us suffer.
As usual, it's the common people who suffer the most.
It seems so peaceful here.
Smoke is rising behind the building. Something must've happened.
We will liberate our homeland soon.
I never thought it will come to war.
Bastards are trying to take our city from us.
I wish we could just live here in peace.
God… It's a massacre. What the hell happened?!
Don't you get it? They blew up these poor people to blame it on the army.
I've certainly seen enough. I hope the army will make them pay.
The whole world needs to learn about this crime.
I feel sick… but I have to find out what happened.
The military is full of nothing but cold-blooded murderers.
What happened here?
Ugh… I… don't remember much. I was waiting in line for water.
There was a blast and I was smashed against the wall… when I regained conciousness, I was covered in blood and everything around me was on fire…
Those bastards from the army must have used mortars against us!
To them, civillians are just as good targets as the rebels...
If you don’t stop, they may decide to stop you themselves! Be reasonable!
Oh, I hope they'll pay for this soon.
You shouldn't be here. It's not safe.
Another badly wounded victim... </n></n>Looks like he is in shock.</n></n>I wish I could do something for him, but he needs a proper medic!
Oh, it's Novak.
Oh! Thanks for watching over my kid.
What are you doing here? Get out of my house!
Don't touch anything! Get out!
Leave, now! Get out!

I used to be a morning radio host before the war. I would share celebrity gossip with my listeners, give them traffic updates and feel-good stories. Everything has changed since the start of the siege. Now there’s little time for trifles, but words can bring hope, and current news can save lives. I have more purpose than ever to run my radio station now, and even though Esma thinks I’m driven, I’ve never felt more part of this community. People of Pogoren need me, and I will continue doing everything in my power to help them.
This place is all we have left of our former lives. I’m severed from my friends, my home and even my son. Every night I pray that he’s still alive and well. Malik is really all I have left, and his closeness keeps me sane. He finds purpose in his radio broadcasts and I help him however I can. He’s a good man who puts the well being of others above his own, so it’s up to me to look after him and protect him.
Broadcast
Now you won't get to shoot anyone else, motherfucker.
A gift to the citizens of Pogoren.
Damn! Somebody must help them!
We foiled your plan, you bastards.
They'll have to be even more careful now.
Novak, you rat! Now you'll get what's coming to you.
No point in taking the risk if there's nothing there.
How many atrocities will it take for the world to react?
It can't be true. I don't believe it.
But they'll deal with you soon. You'll get your just desserts.
Why were you so stubborn… why…?
I let this happen… I should've protected him…
This is my fault… Oh, God!
We have to let people know about the sniper in the park.
I've got news from the park... bad news.
Bloody sniper. Shooting people like targets at the range.
There's a broken supply truck at the gas station.
The army left us all a little gift at the gas station.
I've got good news from the gas station.
We must act quickly. We have to help those people!
The soldiers rounded up civilians at the Central Square.
I've got bad news from the Central Square.
I've got news from the pharmacy.
I overheard the brothers at the pharmacy and I learned something.
I've got news from the bakery.
I went to the bakery… and I got some news.
There was a massacre at the brewery.
I was at the brewery. I'll never forget what I saw.
I haven't learned anything of note.
Slow news day. Sorry.
I've got nothing newsworthy.
Get lost, you little rascal.
Go away or I'll shoot you.
Turn back if you want to live.
I'll try to find out some news tonight.
Malik will be devastated if we stop helping people.
Malik loves what he's doing.
I should walk the city and look for some news.
Hey, got any news?
Yeah, coffee is becoming impossible to get.
The word is that there won't be any deliveries until the next aid drop.
And when will that be? Nobody knows, so the price is going to soar.
Ok, thanks.
Coffee price is bound to rise soon. There's already a shortage and the date of the next aid drop is unknown.

Thank you for warning us about the sniper in the park! It’s better not to think what could have happened if it weren’t for you.
There's probably plenty of fuel in these crates on the other side of the bars.
A letter lies on the ground: "Dear brother, I gathered some fuel for the winter. It seems that I won't need it after all, so I hope that you'll find it useful. Tell Amelia her uncle loves her. Farewell."
The basement of the gas station on Maple Street holds plenty of fuel for the stoves.
A supply truck? I have to find out where it is.
Soldiers might be nearby. I must be careful.
Get the fuck out of here!
Don't shoot! I'm just looking for food.
There is nothing here! Get out or I'll kill you!
Please, there's no need…
Last warning! Get out of here!
I need parts to fix this bloody radio.
I have to find these parts.
Nothing but trash. Just my luck…
Useless junk!
Maybe this… no, screw it.
Just more trash.
I don't know…
This looks interesting.
This might fit!
Come on, where are you?
I'm fucked.
Shit, I'm stuck here.
This bloody radio…
Found the supply truck. I've got useful news for Malik!
Supply crates bearing military markings. They look like they were brought here recently.
This is probably cargo from the truck the soldier was talking about.
Some military papers. Looks like supply manifests. Most of the supplies are routed to the military base, but there is a puzzling delivery of food and supplies for a child addressed to "Bagel's place".
The papers might be supply manifests from the truck this soldier was talking about.
Drag marks, quite deep. They lead straight to the road by the gas station.
The truck should be a bit further ahead, behind the pumps.
Here's the truck. There's plenty of supplies on it, enough to help many starving and sick people.
A damaged army truck. It must've hit something. It's full of crates - judging by the markings, they contain military food rations and medical supplies.
Esma! Have you seen my glasses?
Damn, I misplaced my bloody glasses again.
I'm not afraid. I will do my duty, whatever it takes.
I wish I could listen to some good music.
Bloody leg.
Because of this damned leg, I became a burden.
Esma is a strong woman. We will make it.
This will end soon, I'm sure.
Ugh… I hope they'll fix my leg when everything returns to normal.
I've never lied to anyone…
I will fight to the last breath.
Damned army thugs!
We must hold on, we must be strong, and we can stand through anything.
It's time for an update, but I have no news to broadcast.
Esma, remember to look out for news.
Let's hope we have a story to report on soon.
We need new information.
I feel bad when I have no hard news to broadcast.
Our listeners need our help.
Esma! I need a story! Please try to find something newsworthy.
I'm worried about all those poor people. We must give them some news.
I need something to broadcast!
Esma, please look out for some hard news that I can pass on to people.
People will turn their backs on us if we stop helping them.
If only I had something to share over the radio… I'd feel better.
I have to broadcast something… I'm worried about people.
Esma, please! Our listeners are waiting for any news!
Damn it, Esma—I'm begging you! Do something!
Bloody snipers! I hope at least this one won't get any more kills today.
I hope no more people will fall under this sniper's fire.
I'm so glad we warned people about this sniper.
Well done, Esma! We'll save our fellow citizens from this sniper.
Damned sniper. May this murderer find his match.
The supplies from this army truck should feed a lot of people.
This story about the broken truck—that's what I call hot news!
We helped save lives by letting people know about those supplies.
Let's hope people are done with this truck before the soldiers arrive.
I'm rooting for you people! Clean this truck out like it's a Christmas sale!
May someone help these poor people.
Let's hope that our broadcast was heard by someone who can save these people.
Fascist swine! They torture innocent people.
These torturers deserve no mercy.
I hope our listeners know someone who can free these poor people.
Maybe the army will cancel the attack on the hideout, now that they've lost the element of surprise.
I hope our warning reached the insurgents.
The soldiers will be so mad that we broadcasted their plans!
The insurgents have plenty of time to clear out. The brothers from the pharmacy, too…
I feel like we're really making a difference. Just think how many insurgents would've died if we didn't warn them!
I can't believe Novak stooped so low.
We have to expose Novak—lives are at stake.
I pity Novak's son, but he will be better off in the end. Imagine living with that scum for a father.
There can't be any mercy for snitches. They're like cancer.
What Novak was doing was inexcusable. We had to act.
If this massacre won't get the world's attention, nothing will.
We did our part, exposing this war crime. Now it's the world's turn to act.
All these poor people… The army must pay for its crimes.
Nothing can make it right… but I hope these people in the brewery didn't die in vain.
We knew all along that the army doesn't care about innocent lives. Now everyone will know.
Oh God! Thank you so much!
If you want to get through the park, be careful. The main alley is under sniper fire.
Are you sure?
Go see for yourself. You might get through if you're fast, but it's risky as hell.
Thanks. I need to be absolutely sure.
Hey there! It's wonderful to see someone who doesn't want to kill me.
Please help me, I don't want to go back through the park.
Damned sniper is shooting people there.
Hey! Please, come down here and help me!
Son of a bitch!
Let's go!
Let's go!
I will make it!
Faster!
Now!
Just one more time!
Don't leave me waiting.
Come on!
Thank you! Take care.
Oh God, why?! What a bastard. People should know about this.
May this war end soon.
Honey, watch out for your poor leg.
He's stubborn like a donkey. Both of them are.
It wouldn't hurt to clean up here a bit.
I pray for my boy every day.
A hot bath, some peace and quiet… Eh, no time for pipe dreams.
This place used to be so full of life…
What I would give for a bar of soap!
It's been so long since Pogoren had a quiet night.
I remember how crowded it was here.
I hope the power doesn't go out.
I have to look for news.
We need something worth broadcasting.
We have to warn people about the sniper in the park.
I hope we manage to warn people about the sniper in time.
I dread to think how many people this sniper might hurt before we can warn them.
Bloody sniper. People need to know about him.
This is the most important of all our broadcasts. The massacre at the brewery might sway the world's opinion.
People have to hear about these army supplies—they can put them to good use.
An army truck full of supplies broke down at the gas station!
Malik, let people know about this supply truck.
There's a truck full of supplies at the gas station!
I can't forget what I saw in the brewery. The world has to learn about this crime!
The army has detained innocent people in Central Square! They're going to torture them!
We must let the resistance know about the people held in Central Square.
People imprisoned in Central Square are in danger. We must tell everyone about it!
Malik, if we don't let the world know, these people held in Central Square will be tortured, maybe even killed!
These army thugs accused some random people of being rebels and arrested them. You have to put it on air!
The army is about to hit the rebel hideout in the Zatom district.
The army is moving against the rebels in Zatom. They plan to attack their hideout!
We must warn the rebels about the imminent attack on their hideout in Zatom.
If we don't pass on the message about the attack on the Zatom hideout, many rebels will die.
Malik, we have to broadcast this! Rebels in Zatom are in immediate danger!
We have to warn people about Novak… He's an army informant. He has betrayed us.
Novak from the bakery is ratting people out to the army. We have to warn them.
Malik… we have to tell people that my old friend Novak is an informant.
If we don't warn people about Novak, he'll keep ruining lives. We have to do it.
We can't let Novak carry on with his treachery. He's done enough damage already.
The army is full of nothing but murderers! We have to tell the world about the massacre at the brewery.
Malik, we have to show the world the real face of the army. They killed dozens of people at the brewery!
We have a chance to get the world's attention! This horrible massacre can't be ignored!
Pity we didn’t have better news, the city needs hope now more than ever.
At least people won’t waste time on trips to the pharmacy.
I hate to be the bringer of bad news, but an ugly truth is still better than a pretty lie.
Where are people going to get meds? How much longer will this siege last?
It’s good that I have Esma. Without her, I wouldn’t be able to serve the people.
I wish I could get the name of this informant. That'd be some news!
We warned people about the informant, but that rat is still out there, still ruining lives.
What would I give to know the identity of this traitor! I feel like we're failing our listeners.
Warning people that there's a rat who'll sell them out is like telling them "look out for the bombs and shells".
It's a pity that Novak couldn't name the informant. The insurgents would have dealt with him in no time.
Such a tragedy… Thank God that Esma wasn’t there when it happened.
The rebels preferred to take photos rather than help the wounded… How could they?
How did the rebels know about the explosion so soon? Maybe it’s best not to think about it.
I’m disappointed that the rebels would stoop so low as to lie for propaganda reasons.
A lie is never the way to go. The rebels should know better.
I lied to my husband, but did I have any other choice?
The truth would put both our brothers and us in danger. It’s better this way.
Sometimes we have to choose the lesser of two evils...
People should know there’s no point in searching the pharmacy anymore.
Soldiers at our doorstep is the last thing we need.
We have to warn people about the army informant.
Someone is ratting people out to the army. We have to warn them.
Malik… we have to tell people hiding from the army that someone is selling them out.
If we don't warn people about the informant, they'll get caught by the army.
We can't keep people in the dark about the informant. He's done enough damage already.
I must protect Malik, even at the cost of truth.
I can’t let my husband risk the soldiers’ vengeance.
Maybe the war will be over before the truth comes out.
A gas explosion is a seemingly believable story...
The soldiers will pay for this crime in due time anyway.
We heard you on the radio talking about the army supply truck. For the first time in months, my son and I aren't hungry. Thank you, you’re a godsend!
Good work, friend! Thanks to your broadcast, we were able to rescue those people at Central Square. The butchers holding them got what they deserved.
Give our thanks to Malik for warning us about the attack in Zatom. He saved many lives!
People of Pogoren! We have grave news today, as the government forces attacked the rebels in Zatom. Many people were killed, including civilians. The attack came as a complete surprise. It is yet another black day for Pogoren.
[static]... Outpost delta two here.... [static]... report… Sir, we’ve lost our informer at the bakery. [static] Those rogue broadcasters exposed him. [static]... I suggest we locate them and end their meddling [static]... over.
Under the cover of darkness, a Grazni death squad rounded up and executed many civilians in Zatom. Many of those murdered were known for their sympathies towards the Vyseni people.
Thank you for spreading the news of the ordeal that we're going through. I hope those responsible for these atrocities stand trial after all this is over!
We just heard on the radio that what happened in the old brewery was an accident. That’s a filthy lie! I was there! I heard the sound of approaching mortar shells! I saw the explosions! My two brothers died in there!
The park is considered a relatively safe area. There are no buildings to attract mortar barrages, and availability of cover discourages snipers.
This was one of the very first places people looted during their flight from the city. There had been a few-hours long ceasefire intended to let the civilians leave the area, but it was broken. Many people died, and neither side admits responsibility to this day. Despite the fact that the whole district has been heavily shelled, the station is in surprisingly decent shape. It may have been looted, but it might still be worth checking out.
The city center used to be beautiful - with parks, squares and monuments, all surrounded by old buildings. The war has taken its toll on the area.
A deserted small house where a locally famous actress used to live. People say that a man who lost everything in the war can sometimes be seen bustling about there.
It looks safe…

This used to be the warehouse of a big store. Currently it's used as a hideout by a group of armed thugs. We might find useful things there if we can sneak in, but it is very dangerous.

The ruin of the most luxurious hotel in Pogoren still houses the best music club in the basement. Not much of its pre-war splendor survived, but people come here to meet kindred spirits and forget the war for a while.
I hope my old friend is still in business.
Before the war, the biggest toy store in the city was packed with throngs of children begging parents for dolls, games, models, candies and a million other things. Now its ruins stand silent and empty.
Lack of supplies put the pharmacists out of business… but not before they made a fortune.
I wonder if Novak still lives here.
FirstEnterComment
Franko, the trader, paid us a visit to thank you.
He used to go through the park every night. Your broadcast probably saved his life.
You see? We're protecting people! It's worth it no matter what.
He's very grateful.
The rebels freed the people who were imprisoned at Central Square.
All the soldiers who were there died in the fighting.
We're finally making a difference.
Honey, I'm scared. The army's started looking for you.
Esma, we are saving lives. That's neither easy nor safe.
We must tell people the truth. They need it desperately in these times.
But if something happens to you, what then? Who will help them?
We can cower in fear or stand and fight.
For me the choice is easy. We must have courage to live in truth.
Do you think Adem is safe? I worry about him so much.
I worry about people he might be ordered to kill.
He's still your son.
He abandoned the truth out of blind loyalty to the country that betrayed us.
Oh Adem… why?
Can we help your friend Novak somehow?
He must be desperate, trying to provide for his kid alone.
I can't stop thinking about him since you told me how broke he is.
Please, Malik, don't worry so much. There's nothing we can do.
Life must have gotten unbearable for him after he lost his wife.
I'm so happy to have you.
I can't stop thinking about Novak's son.
What happened to him?
Don't worry. The rebels are not like those army thugs.
He's somewhere safe, I'm sure.
My mind keeps coming back to what I saw in the brewery.
The soldiers who fired the shells… How can they look in the mirror?
They are terrorists. So many innocent people died.
Please, honey, don't torture yourself.
Yes, honey… But please, let it go. They will pay for it.
I can't wrap my head around it. I thought that the rebels were better than that.
What do you mean?
The explosion at the brewery. I can't believe they would forge false evidence to get the attention of the world.
Using people's tragedy for the purposes of their propaganda… Is that really necessary?
Thank you! I heard your warning about the sniper in the park.
It used to be on my daily route. You probably saved my life.
I just wanted to let you know how important you are to us.
Thank you for letting us know about that truck with supplies.
I desperately needed medicine for my daughter. I found some there.
My little girl will live thanks to you!
I'm so glad to hear that. Take care!
I'm sure you barely scrape by, like most everyone. And we just came upon a food cache!
I'm sure you barely scrape by, like most everyone. And we just came upon a food cache!
The Grazni must pay for it. The world has to know.
Following the massacre in Zatom, the rebels pushed back against the Grazni and managed to seize and execute an informer by the name of Novak.
I'll never repay you for saving my wife, but… I brought you some food.
Thank you so much.
It's a pack of herbs and vegetables.
Anonymous letter thrown through the window. “A soldier was killed because of your radio broadcast. The military is sniffing around. Take care.”
Let's scan the channels for news.
Nothing of interest yet.
That's nothing new…
Maybe I'll try the short waves.
Aha! Got something!
That's some news!
We got news.
All channels are quiet.
Aw, damn. Nothing.
Nobody has any news.
Zero, null, nothing.
This sounds interesting.
The military is threatening us, trying to intimidate us. All the more reason to repeat that we will keep telling you the truth no matter what.
Someone wrote on the wall:</n></n>"Don't listen to the radio, they are lying to us!"
Why'd someone write this? We are helping people…
Access to our herb garden was cut off by a recent hit. We have to dig through the rubble.
At least we can roll our own cigarettes.
Hello! Don't be afraid...
I just think I recognize you.
You work for the radio, right?
I have something to say to you!
We have to let people know about the sniper in the park.
We have to broadcast the news about the sniper.
We have to warn people about the sniper in the park.
Now that we know about Novak's treachery, I have to warn our listeners!
I have to expose Novak. If I don't do it, lives will be in danger.
We have the news about the supply truck, we should pass it on to the people.
We have to broadcast the news about the broken supply truck.
We have to let people know about the supply truck at the gas station.
We must tell the world about the massacre in the brewery.
I have to broadcast the truth about the massacre in the brewery.
We learned about the people held at the Central Square, we should broadcast it.
We have to broadcast the news about the people held at the Central Square. Somebody has to free them!
We have to let our listeners know about the people detained at the Central Square.
I have to warn people about Novak's treason.
The truth about the massacre is the most important news I've ever gotten!
I have to warn the insurgents about the attack.
I need to broadcast the news about the planned army attack.
We have news about the impending attack. I have to get it on air.
Esma. It's been a while.
You haven't changed at all since the world went to hell.
You don't look too shabby yourself, Gustav.
And what a nice place you got here.
Yeah, would be a shame if something happened to it. Only thing that keeps me going.
Actually, it hasn't been so bad lately. I've been getting more patrons since your last broadcast.
Many soldiers died. Many more good people were saved.
I really appreciate what you do, but you could be a bit more careful about it.
People are starting to talk. Word is, the army is after you. You really did a number on them.
It's getting dangerous to carry on with your work. Maybe you should lay low for a while.
Thanks for the warning, Gustav. I'll talk with Malik about it.
Don't get yourself killed.
Oh, Esma! It's good to see you alive and well.
Hi, I'm glad to see you too.
How are you doing?
I'm fine. I actually managed to stock up on food, first time in weeks.
Your broadcasts are a great help.
Listening to Malik gives me hope that we can hold on until the war ends.
Tell him that I support what you do. Take care.
Thanks. It's good to hear this at least once.
Oh, it's you. I know you.
Really? I don't…
It's your fault things went to hell around here.
I beg your pardon?
Don't play dumb. You and your husband…
All your prattling on the radio did was piss off the soldiers.
They take it out on us. Completely innocent people.
My dear… why… No, please!
Oh my God, I can't go on…
Someone is going to visit us today. We should wait for them.
Who’s that?
I can't go on without you…
What will I do?
Malik… my love… I don't want to live without you…
God, why?! Why?!
It's over. There's no point in struggling anymore.
Adem, how are we going to survive?
It's so good to have you back.
Malik… my love… I don't want to live without you…
My son has returned, but can I forgive him?
No matter what, you're my child and I love you...
They sit crammed in a cellar and can only wait until they're taken for questioning.
I can't help you now, but I'll pass on the word to people who can.
Novak from the bakery got his due
I was in the bakery yesterday. That fucking rat Novak got what he deserved. You did well.
Mom, I'm with you… don't worry, I won't leave you.
You must rest. I'll take care of everything.
We must be strong.
I will find a way to repair the radio. We could carry on Dad's work.
I want to fight back.
God, it's all so hard...
Hey! I know you're there!
We need to find the strength to go on...
You're all I have left...
I'm here for you, Mom.
We'll look after each other from now on.
We're going through very hard times, ^CharacterName^.
But eventually it will get better.
I don't know if I can go on like this.
You have to try! I'm not giving up on you.
You're always there for me when I need you.
I love you so much.
^CharacterName^, we have to talk.
I know it's really hard, but we can't give up!
We've been doing everything we can…
And for what? This siege is getting worse and worse.
We need to be strong. The people need us!
Think of all the good we're doing with our radio.
I'll try to be strong for you... I love you.
Oh, Malik… I miss you so much…

Mom, are you all right?
I'm holding up… don't worry.
Are you sure? I know it's hard, but you have to hang in there! I need you.
Oh, Adem… I just need to rest a while.
Sure, Mom. I'll take care of everything!
Two brothers who lived on the first floor used to run a successful pharmacy there. Maybe it’s worth checking if they’re still alive after the recent shelling. If they're okay and have some medical supplies, Malik could inform the people - they’d be relieved to know.
Novak used to be my friend. He ran the best bakery in the city, but I haven’t seen him since the siege began. Maybe it’s not a bad idea to visit him - he might even have some food to spare.
One of the oldest buildings in the city. It housed a prosperous brewery, which started gaining international recognition shortly before the war. Its well is one of the few drinking water sources in the city, and people come there with all kinds of containers from miles around.
This block of flats has seen some heavy fighting. Most people fled the area before the Vyseni rebels clashed there with the military. The battle is over now, and there should be many things left to scavenge since people were leaving in a rush.
St. Mary's Church is still a place of meetings for the local community. Father Olek is known for his charitable work, often offering refuge to the poor.
I heard that something terrible has happened in the music club.
We found out that taking a boat from the river port is the least dangerous way to escape from Pogoren.
Destroyed Music Club
Necessary to remove heaps of hard-packed rubble.
I'm too tired for this.
This is exhausting. I could use some sleep.
It's so tiring.
Two drunken thugs… I'd better find another way.
You'll be sorry!
I really hope the war will end soon...
Well, I see your point... but what about all the innocent people who were saved?
Innocent, my ass. If the army rounded them up, they must've been up to no good.
Now that's just bullshit. I think you've had enough.
I'm just telling you how it is… and now the soldiers will come and fuck us all up.
Like they weren't doing it anyway. You better go home now.
I think I had too much…
Ah, screw it! Pour me another.
Only thing that keeps me sane.
I need more.
Wow, I'm so pissed!
What the fuck did you say?!
Calm down, man… here's to you.
Fuck, I've had enough.
Bloody war…
Hey, you lost?! Get the fuck out!
You looking for trouble? Get lost!
It's our party, sod off!
Beat it, or I'll make you dance.
Yes, good choice! Scram!
There might still be something important to broadcast.
Prisoners? Shit, if the guards see me, I'm dead.
Oh, God. Are you okay? What's going on?
Help us! The soldiers locked us up after some fucker they call 'Bagel' told them that we are rebel supporters.
They keep asking us about our contacts among the rebels, but we don't know anything!
They are going to torture us! Please!
I'd best leave this to Malik.
This is the one thing I won't do for Malik.
I'm not the radio host here.
It takes more than just pushing a button to speak.
I can't wrap my head around it.
The silence in this place sends shivers down my spine.
Park alley under sniper fire
I learned that a sniper is shooting at people in the main park alley. I passed the news to Malik so he can warn the listeners.
Supplies at the gas station
I found out that there's a broken down army truck full of supplies at the burned gas station. I relayed this to Malik.
People detained at the Central Square
I learned that the army is holding some people at the Central Square. I told Malik about them so he can summon help.
They killed him
Malik is dead. They came in the night and shot him in cold blood.
The army is looking for us
I heard from the bartender that the soldiers are looking for us.
They are fucked. Now it's just a matter of time until they spill everything.
I don't know yet. They are busy. The tip from Bagel was a real surprise.
Yeah. But once the interrogation team is here, these punks will confess everything or die.
When are the intelligence guys coming?
So we just have to wait… Good to be out of the line of fire for a while.
I wish we could just wipe out these damned rebels and go home.
I knew this day would come… It's getting really scary.
What should we do about this truck at the gas station? There's probably plenty of supplies in it.
We could take something, though I'd have to avoid the driver. He's alone, but he's still an armed soldier.
Esma, we're fine. What we should do is broadcast this news to people in need.
We're helping people, but I don't know how much longer we can keep doing it.
The army won't sit on their hands listening to our broadcasts.
That's true. But this is the price of changing the situation in our city.
It's worth it, my love.
We must do something about those people held by the army in the Central Square.
Only the rebels can help them, but I don't know any contacts.
Me neither. That's why we have to broadcast this information.
I won't just sit around while people are being tortured by those maniacs.
Honey, what you said on air about the soldiers watching prisoners in Central Square…
You called on the rebels to execute them. Wasn't that too much?
No. Those fuckers from the army will pay for their every crime against people of Pogoren.
The army is planning a strike against the rebels. Maybe we can thwart them again.
What a horrible crime… I have to tell Malik about it.
I hope people will manage to take the supplies from the truck before the army gets there, and that no one will get hurt.
I hope our broadcast about the supply truck helped some people. We’re all in this together - we must aid each other however we can.
This horrible letter... Nobody has ever threatened to kill Malik before! What should I do?
I had a brush with death in the park, but I’m alive. Others were less fortunate.
How can the army terrorize innocent civilians? That bloody sniper... I hope the rebels get him. They’ll know what to do with him.
Let's hope the rebels have heard our broadcast and free those poor people. How can the government forces torture their own citizens?
The military is getting even more brutal towards civilians. I’d wager none of the people detained in Central Square actually has anything to do with the rebels.
Oh my God! The army has started looking for us! How long will it take before they find us?
By warning the rebels, we put our lives and those of the two men in danger, all in hope of saving many more. Did we do the right thing?
I feel guilty for lying to Malik, but I couldn't let him risk his life for the rebels. At least the brothers from the pharmacy are safe.
I understand Novak has children to look after, but what he’s been doing is unforgivable, regardless of his motives.
I really hope protecting Novak was the right decision. Would I act differently if I were in his place?
I'm so proud of Esma. It must’ve been really hard for her, but she didn't let her friendship stand in the way of truth.
Damn it, if only we had known the identity of the informer, we could have saved more people!
I will never forget the faces of the dead I saw in the brewery. The world must be informed of the horrible things these soldiers do to civilians!
I hope Malik never finds out that I lied to him about the massacre at the brewery. I only did it to protect him, but he wouldn’t understand.
The military must answer for their crimes when all this is over! Punishing them will not undo the harm they’ve caused, but we will have justice.
It saddens me that the rebels would use people’s misfortune to fuel their propaganda, whether the military are actually guilty or not. I thought better of them.
Malik's body. Numerous bruises indicate that he was brutally beaten and mutilated.
Destroyed transmitter. Plenty of parts will be needed to fix it.
Remains of Malik's journal. Only the last page is readable: "Remember Esma's birthday next week. Tell Franko beforehand to try to get flowers."
Those bastards can come after me, too. I have nothing to live for anymore…
Maybe we should fix the radio…
Oh, my dear…
I heard about Malik. What a terrible loss…
I share your grief… and anger.
I wish I could help you. Do you need anything?
Thank you… we'll manage.
I understand.
What if we just left Pogoren…?
I think we should take the chance and leave.
Maybe it's time to leave it all behind.
We ought to carry on Malik's work.
Malik would have wanted his work to be continued.
Maybe we can repair the radio and keep on fighting.
Our place wasn't the only one targeted by these bastards!
Bastards… they hit the music club, too.
We weren't the only target…
There are transmitter parts in the music club…
Maybe we could use the parts from the music club to fix the transmitter?
These radio parts… I'm not sure.
We could escape this city.
This is hopeless… I don't want to be here any longer.
We could take the chance and leave this all behind.
It's time to leave this damned city.
Mom, are we going to carry on Dad's work?
I wish I could. But I'm not sure I have it in me…
We could go to Pier 9, take the boat…
Leave it all behind… It's tempting.
We have to decide, Adem.
Fresh blood on the ground. Something bad happened here recently.
Lots of footprints from heavy soldier shoes. It's certainly not the best idea to hang around here.
Unikac walki na lokacji (starac sie przejsc niezauwazonym) bo jest niestety szansa 50/50 ze przy wyjsciu z lokacji po walce gra sie scrashuje.
How much longer will we wait for those bloody intelligence guys?
Don't get any closer, you idiot!
You made your death wish.
I will never forgive myself for being too late...
That I ran away in the first place...
Oh God… I hope my friend is safe.
Get the fuck out of here—right now!
I’ve always thought of myself as a patriot first, and a Vyseni second. When the insurgency began, I was horrified how my country was being torn apart by a clique of politicians stocking nationalist agendas and setting people against their former friends and neighbours. After a particularly long and bitter argument with my father, I stormed out and enlisted in the government army. By the time I realized my mistake, it was already too late to go back.
Franko told us that some thugs are occupying his old apartment and there is a photo album there that he wants to get back. If we help him, he'll give us the transmitter parts we need to fix the radio.</n>
Damn the army! To think I was one of them…
I'm not afraid of these army bastards.
I wish I could listen to some good music.
What would I give to turn back time…
I want to stay here and fight.
Your father needs help! We have to talk to him.
May this horror end soon.
I'm so sorry I left…
Why was I so stupid!
Enlisting was the dumbest thing I did in my life.
Bloody army thugs!
Adem, please… I think it's too soon to escape the city.
I don't want to leave my husband.
The government is happy to see us suffer.
It's been years since I've been to a football match.
Now I’ll never have a chance to tell you how sorry I am…
Mom, I wish I had never left you. I know it’s too late for that, but I’m so sorry...
I understand. Just remember, please — I’m here for you now.
This will not bring Dad back. It's good to see your face again, to know you’re alive, but I need more time…
I wish your father could hear this. Now all you can do is help me bury him.
Father… I'm here to arrange a funeral.
Oh, my dear… So the rumors were true. I'm so sorry…
It's my fault! I should’ve stopped him… protected him!
You mustn't blame yourself. You both brought hope into the hearts of so many people.
I can't… It’s so hard now that he’s gone. I just want it all to end.
You need time to heal. If you want to leave it all behind, there's a boat leaving Pogoren from Pier 9.
Thank you. I’ll have to think about it…
And don’t worry about the funeral. I'll take care of everything.
Please accept my condolences.
I’m sorry, but it’s too difficult for me to talk about it right now.
I understand very well. I’ve been through that. I just hope someone will continue his work.
Malik is gone and so is his radio. Nobody can replace him.
The radio wasn't only Malik…
Such a tragedy… First Gustav, now Malik.
Gustav, from the Music Club? What happened?!
Those army bastards… They learned there was plenty of radio equipment at the music club.
You are Esma, right? You and your husband run the Pogoren Glas radio!
We did… My husband… Malik… He’s gone.
Oh my God, I’m so sorry.
I don't care anymore… I’ve already lost everything.
Please don’t say that! There’s always something or someone worth living for!
My son… I didn’t even tell him what a relief it was to see him again…
Esma! I never had a chance to thank Malik, and now I never will.
There’s nothing to thank me for…
You and your husband saved our daughter!
And now he’s gone…
But you are not! The war is still going on and many people are going to need help.
Thank you for your kind words, but my family has suffered too much already.
The priest said he'll take care of everything.
Some people stopped by to talk to me.
So many people will miss him…
His death doesn’t have to be the end of it all.
Or maybe we should leave this city before it kills us.
It’s really late, Adem. We’ll talk about it later…
Stay here with your father’s body. I’ll find the priest and ask him about the burial.
Esma! I’m so glad you're alive.
I don't want to run away again.
Esma's Scavenge
Some of them are in my church now. Talk to them, please.
You've earned a place on it with everything you did for the people of this city.
Just do me a favor and stay with us for a while—talk to the people.
After my wife passed away, Malik's voice kept me company during my long, lonely nights.
I don’t know what I will do without it.
I’ll leave you with that thought. Be well, Esma.
They trashed the place to make sure we keep our mouths shut.
They killed Gustav when he tried to stop them. Fucking monsters.
This war is taking the best people away.
You see? There is always a light… Be well, Esma.
But at least I can thank you.
She was very ill, and we heard Malik talking about the medical drop.
You should carry on his work.
They are very grateful for Father's help.
...but all their gratitude won’t bring him back.
We can continue his work. It's helped so many…
There's a boat leaving from Pier 9… We can board it.
For once, I want to do what’s right.
What would Father want us to do?
Transmitter Parts
These parts are necessary to repair the transmitter.
The transmitter is broken.
We need radio parts to fix it.
I have to look for radio parts.
Ok, mom… We're set.
I picked up his mike after the army murdered him.
He died for the truth he'd been sharing with you.
Pogoren Glas is on air again. I'm Adem, Malik's son.
But he won't be silenced. We will carry on his work.
To say what needs to be said.
Because we are your voice.
The Voice of Pogoren.
Loud voices inside… I have to be careful.
Get out of here!
I'm done…
You really piss me off!
You lost, baby?
I would bring Malik news, and now... what is left?
What happened here?
What the hell happened here?
Destroyed audio equipment.
Execution was fast and brutal.
An unarmed civilian's body. Someone just opened the door and executed him.
Your Voice Of Pogoren.
Thank you… this is very kind of you.
Please, I need bandages.
Text on the wall: "Keep your mouths shut if you want to live"
Oh my God, all these people died because the army wanted to end our broadcasts…
Maybe we can use those parts to repair our radio.
The army was here… they didn't even bother removing the bodies.
This War of Mine
This is Malik...
...broadcasting once again from war-torn Pogoren…
...this night was calm. So far…
...a few shots heard around the block.
But you can rest assured…
...we'll be there for you…
...to report and denounce...
...to say what needs to be said...
...a voice that remains unheard.
You are a good person.
Ugh… I knew they planned to do this… It looks so different from this perspective than it looked from inside the army…
Yet another body…
Help me, please! I'm wounded and I can't move.
Soldiers stormed in and started shooting everybody. Then they smashed the audio equipment.
They thought someone here had something to do with your broadcasts.
They are all dead now, because of you! Please, at least help me…
Soldiers stormed in and started shooting everybody. Then they smashed the audio equipment.
They thought someone here had something to do with your broadcasts.
So now they are all dead… I'm the only survivor. Please, help me.
I'm badly wounded.
I'm badly wounded.
They want to frighten us.
They're gone… It's so terribly empty here.
I hope Novak's son is safe and sound.
God, it's my fault that they took them…
The insurgents found out somehow about Novak's treachery and took him… and his son.
Novak's son's toys lying on the ground in chaos.
They left a complete mess… Whatever happened here, it wasn't expected nor pleasant.
You took your sweet time… Can we talk?
-
-
Hey, we need to talk!
Come on! Open the door!
Thank you!
Open the goddamn door.
Let's talk.
I need to talk to you.
Hey, let's talk.
Finally! I have something to tell you.
-
-
Have you heard about Novak from the bakery? He's gone. His son too.
The rebels searched his place and it turns out he was an informer.
Wasn't he a friend of yours? Maybe it was you who warned him?
Water will be given out at the brewery.
Please announce it on the air, so people know to come.
Ok, I just need to go there and make sure.
Petar was on Novak's list! I need to warn him!
Oh, God! No!
What happened here?!
Malik?! Answer me!
Malik!
Are you there?
Oh no!
He's gone…
The transmitter is destroyed… Those who did it must've taken Malik.
Who could they be? Why did they do this?
I have to look for clues.
I need a lead to start looking for Malik.
Good day Esma! I just wanted you to tell Malik something…
He'd better watch what he says on the radio. Pissing off the army is unwise.
Think about it. You don't want a death squad at your door, do you?
I need to tell you something!
Good! I’ll come to pick you up in a few days. Until then, be safe, my friend!
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
Hey there! I need to tell you something!
Hey! I know you're there, I have some information for you!
Please, hear me out!
I just need to tell you something. Open the door!
Hey, let's talk.
Can we talk?
Hear me out, please.
Good to see you. Can we talk?
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
It's great to see you. I need to talk to you.
Good! I’ll come to pick you up in a few days. Until then, be safe, my friend!
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
Esma, we need to talk!
Esma, I need to talk to you.
Esma, please!
I just wanna talk, Esma. Open the door, please.
Esma, let's talk.
Can we talk, Esma?
Esma… Hear me out, please.
Good to see you, Esma. Can we talk?
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
I've heard your broadcast about the massacre at the brewery.
That took courage, but I fear that you have crossed the line.
Those army bastards won't forgive you for this.
I heard your broadcast about the massacre at the brewery.
What a mess you made… The insurgents are very angry with you.
They are accusing the army, but people no longer know who to believe.
The lock is broken. The kidnappers forced their way in.
Many footprints on the floor. Large sizes.
A hand rolled cigarette stub.
The transmitter is destroyed. We'd need plenty of parts to fix it.
Some blood spatter on the floor. Not much, which means the injuries were minor.
The footprint were left by various boots. The kidnappers weren't soldiers…
They came for Malik, but also came to silence our radio…
I hope I'm not mistaken…
At last. You are in deep shit, you know?
Good! I’ll come to pick you up in a few days. Until then, be safe, my friend!
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
You hear me? Open the door!
Open this goddamned door!
You are fucked, you know?! Open the door!
You bastard, I need to talk to you.
You'll regret what you did.
We need to talk.
At last. You are in deep shit, you know?
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Open the door, you bastard. We need to talk.
I told you to warn the rebels about the attack. Why the fuck did you lie?!
Many good people died because of your cowardice.
I already let the insurgents know about this. They will make you pay.
Mom! I'm so glad to see you! Is Dad all right?
He… He was kidnapped.
No! I'm too late…
They came in the night and took him. I don't know who…
I deserted when I heard that the army is coming after you!
I wanted to warn you…
I’m so sorry for everything. Will you let me in?
Come in… we have to plan what to do next.
Another pile of documents. One of the notes draws your attention: "We have several more trails to check regarding those radio transmissions. We're getting closer, shutting them down is just a matter of time."
It looks like some papers left here by soldiers… They must have moved out of here in a hurry.
Documents and letters, some of them with the army's signs. It seems that they had some kind of hideout here, but left without taking care of everything.
Damn, they are really after us. I need to talk with Malik about this immediately!
Shit… it looks like they've been working to find us for quite some time…
I found a note about us among army papers. They are really after us.
They are, for sure. It means we are doing something that matters.
[static]... C23, can you hear me? [static]... that damned radio broadcast compromised my position and people stopped using the route through the park. Someone should do something about that rogue broadcaster… over.
Received
Mom, you still want to contact Dad?
I do…
Even after you've read this letter?
I know, but… I still have to apologise to him.
I hope he can forgive me.
Mom, open your eyes! He doesn't care about us!
We could try to leave the city. I've heard there's a boat at the port - one captain has made it.
We can leave it all behind!
And that's all for tonight…
I’ll get back to you with news soon.
For now I leave you…
...with hope for a better tomorrow.
Good night, Pogoren.
Letter with information about people held in prison. It is signed 'Bagel'.
Nothing here…
That's some bullshit!
More government propaganda…
Still nothing…
Same old…
Fuck, how can you be like that, brother? There are good people there who just want the war to end...
Listen to me! Stop chumming up to these rebels! You're in danger, I'm telling you!
Now you're bullshitting me just to make me stop.
The army has learned about the rebel hideout! They'll hit it any day now!
Oh fuck! I need to go warn them.
No, you idiot, you'll kill us both! The army can figure out who did it!
Just shut the fuck up! Stop bothering me with this!
Esma! You probably heard our argument…
I did… The military is about to attack a rebel hideout...
Yes! Your husband has to warn everyone over the radio!
If we remain silent, many more will get hurt!
Alright, I'll talk to Malik.
You’re this radio operator’s wife, right?
You’d better keep your mouth shut, if you know what’s good for you!
You’re pissing me off… I’m going for a cigarette.
Good riddance!
Pharmacist's body riddled with bullets. This was an execution.
God… Bastards… I hope it's not because of our broadcast.
Some of the pharmacist's things are missing. It looks like he left in a hurry.
Hey, do you know what happened to Novak and his kid?
They were taken away. By the rebels, I think.
I was looking for food nearby when I saw several armed people enter the bakery.
I heard them shouting inside, then a couple of shots…
But after a while they all got out with Novak and his child still alive.
Do you know where they took them?
I have no idea what happened after that. I was too scared to follow them.
I've learned about an imminent attack on a separatists' hideout. We have to warn them.
If Malik warns the rebels, the army may seek revenge. I’ll only tell him about the empty shelves in the pharmacy.
Malik is gone. Someone came in the night and kidnapped him.
My friend Novak is the army's spineless informer. We need to warn people.
Exposing Novak would put his child and us in danger. We should warn the people without revealing who the snitch is.
Bagel exposed
The army is responsible for a massacre of civilians. We need to let the world know about this war crime.
Explosion at the brewery
The army killed many innocent people at the brewery, but if Malik reports it, they might hurt him. Maybe it’s better to lie?
He is gone
Rebels in danger
You! Where's my husband?! Where's Malik! What did you do to him?!
His broadcasts did a lot of damage.
But you know that very well, don't you?
You don't understand! I was trying to protect him!
You made this decision for him. Now he can decide for himself.
I need to see him… please, at least for a while!
I'm afraid that's not going to happen.
I don't believe you! My husband wouldn't do this to me…
You lied to him! Betrayed him! If you don't believe me, talk to Gustav.
Now leave me alone!
He was repeating the lies of the army. We had to stop it.
He told us that it was you. You were lying to him all the time!
He's with us in our hideout and as far as I know, he doesn't want to see you.
Ask him to show you the letter from Malik I gave him.
Gustav! Somebody took Malik away tonight! Do you know anything about it?
Actually, I do…
But I think you're not going to like it.
The insurgents took Malik… They were furious about his false and harmful broadcasts.
Is he alive?!
He's safe. It seems he had no idea his sources were unreliable.
You were feeding him lies, Esma!
You don't…
He's with the insurgents now… And I don't think he wants to see you.
You don't understand! I need to find him…
You can talk to one of the guys who took Malik away… He sits at the table nearby.
But Esma… It's all your fault. You lied to all of us.
Gustav! Why didn't you tell me about the letter from Malik?
Because he wrote this letter to me.
I need to see it! Please, Gustav…
Dear Gustav,</n>I asked one of the rebels to pass this letter on to you, as you're probably my last real friend in the city.Esma has been lying to me all this time, knowing how important these broadcasts were. She knew that the radio was my life, and she took it away from me.I'll stay with the rebels and try to repair the damage she did. I don't want to see her ever again.Stay safe my friend. Malik.
Oh God… so it was true…
Excuse me… Do you know anything about the kidnapping of Malik, the radio man?
He was taken from our home tonight.
No; haven't heard a thing. Sorry.
Could you get me some radio parts? I need them to fix the transmitter.
I might, but it won't be easy. So I'm going to ask you to do me a favor in return.
Some bastards threw me out of my own house. I want you to recover my family photos.
You'll have to be very careful. These people are dangerous.
I'll mark the place on your map. Deal?
All right. I'll try to get your photos back.
Do you have the radio parts?
Yeah, I managed to get them. Do you have my family photos?
I've got them right here.
Great! I'm glad you haven't gotten yourself killed.
Docelowo znalezienie albumu ze zdjeciami ma byc zalezne od podniesienia itemu w skrzynce ktora tu stoi. Poki ten feature nie dziala, dzieje sie to na trigger.
So, are you ready?
Yes… let's go.
All right then.
You want to leave the city? We are casting off soon.
We can still find someplace aboard.
So, if you want to run away, let's talk business.
My love… I'm so sorry…
What will I do?
Malik… my love… I don't want to live without you…
God, why?! Why?!
I only did it to protect you…
I have to fix the transmitter and talk to Malik.
I'm not sure if I want to leave.
I hope Malik can forgive me. I have to talk to him.
I have to talk to my love.
We know how to fix the transmitter. We just need the radio parts.
Fixing the radio is the only way to contact Malik.
I want to speak to my husband.
Please, let's fix this damned transmitter.
This letter… oh, Malik.
The smirk on this insurgent's face… I want to wipe it off with my fists.
These assholes! How could they take him from me?!
Gustav… I thought he was my friend.
Oh, Dad, I was such a fool…
I wish I could turn back time.
I miss you, Dad. I regret that we parted in anger.
Those motherfuckers killed my father. To think I associated with them!
We should carry on Dad's work. We should make the army suffer.
I don't want to see Dad's work undone.
We must fight on… For Dad's honor and freedom!
We mustn't give up! We have to fight on!
Dad would want us to carry on his work.
Dad always was an egoist.
Let's escape Pogoren and leave it all behind.
Screw this radio. We have to leave this city.
Dad… why are you such a bastard?
I must protect my mother.
Mom, I'll never leave you again, I swear.
Damn this radio to hell. Let's leave.
The boat is waiting in the port… we just have to go there.
Franko's photo album with his family pictures.
Photo album
Fixed transmitter
The transmitter is now fixed and usable again.
And that would be it for this guy.
The poor bastard was unlucky he met us, ha ha ha.
Yeah, nobody messes with us!
You said it, brother!
Oh! Hello, Esma! Could you give us a moment?
We just need to finish our discussion... Can you please wait in the other room?
Hello!? Is anyone there!?
I can hear someone downstairs.
I can hear Davor and his brother.
Davor,</n>Thank you for supporting our cause. Helping our brothers and sisters is our duty. Long live the Republic of Vysena!
Davor supporting the rebels? That's something new.
How's it going? Is the bar open?
Yep.
Thanks!
Oh, someone wants a drink!
What happened?
Please don't die!
What… what happened?
Please help! My husband is dying in my arms! Help!
I don't know how…
Please! He's dying!
Are you ok? There are so many wounded…
I’ll be ok… Thank you…
Shells fell on us as we were waiting for water...
Please help that man out there, he's still alive.
Shit, so many people in need of help! I'll try!
Please help!
He's dying! Help!
Someone at the music club might have the transmitter parts we need to fix the radio. However, the word in the streets is that something terrible happened there recently. We'd better be careful.
Don't die! Honey, please, don't die!
Noo! God, Why?!
Let this nightmare end!
My husband died!
He's dead! What now?!
It will be ok. We'll get you out of here.
Hold on. You'll make it.
Your brother will get here soon.
Please, be strong. It will be okay.
So many bloody footprints... Lots of people must've been here since the explosion.
Don't believe those Rebels. They are responsible for all of this.
What?! I don't believe you. Army shot those mortar shells.
Oh,you're so naive. Why would they? Rebels want to get international support with this.
What? If so, why?
Only they have something to gain. They will try to get international support now.
Another body horribly mutilated by an explosion... obviously the result of a shelling.</n></n>The world should hear about the atrocities commited by the Grazni military, but must we be the ones to report them?
My God! What happened here...
What...
Please, please... He must stay alive!
Hold on. God, please, hold on!
I'm afraid he didn't make it... There was nothing I could do...
I'm sorry... I need to take care of other people.
Oh God... So many dead!
This was Adem's stroller when he was a baby. After all these years, his favourite plush doggie is still inside.
Oh, Adem... Why did you have to enlist, son?
Ok, Mom… We're set.
Pogoren Glas is on-air again. I'm Esma, Malik's wife.
Malik, my love, I hope you can hear me... I'm sorry...
I should never have lied to you...
I only did it to protect you... I was afraid I'd lose you…
I'm sorry... I hope one day you can forgive me...
Your loving wife.
Raided Music Club
My friend is severely wounded… It all happened so suddenly...
Go see for yourself… I need to take care of him.
You hear me? You'll be fine.
Your brother is on the way.
We'll get you out of this place, just hold on.
Run for your life! Who knows if it's over?
What are you talking about?! Hey, wait!
Oh my God... He's seriously injured!
It's... it's horrible…
So many dead and wounded... It must've been some kind of explosion.
So many dead bodies... blood everywhere... What happened here? Some kind of explosion?
Bodies everywhere... What happened here?
Wait, you’re from the radio, aren’t you?
I’d advise you to keep quiet about what happened here.
Malik will want to inform the people about this horrible tragedy on the radio, but the soldiers won't take kindly to a whistleblower drawing attention to their war crimes.</n></n>What should I do?!</n></n>Come on, Esma. Think!</n></n>Hmm... there are some gas pipes here... this gives me an idea...
Maybe I can cover up all this mess as an accident... an unfortunate gas explosion.
It might be remnant of a mortar shell...
Some people might have hid here soon after the bombardment.
More water containers...
The Last Broadcast
Are you here to get out of the city? It's not cheap, you know.
Yes... After everything that happened to my husband, Malik...
Anyway, they might be gearing up for the assault as we speak! It's too dangerous!
It's war. People die all the time. I don't want you to join them, so stay put until I return!

Radio parts found
We have found parts that will allow us to repair our radio.
Photo album found
We have found the photo album that Franko wanted. We will exchange it for the parts necessary to repair our radio!
Someone is trapped in a collapsed basement at the toy store. Several people are needed to remove the debris! Somebody help him, please!
Is anybody there?! Please, help me!
What?! Hey! What happened?!
I hid in the basement during the bombardment several days ago.
Did I hear somebody downstairs?
One of the explosions made the ceiling collapse and I got stuck here.
I'm starving and dying of thirst here, please help me!
I cannot help you myself, but I will try to get someone to help you!
Bye, Mom.
A soldier's dead body. He was badly beaten and died of multiple nasty wounds.
This soldier either died guarding the supplies... or surrenderred and was lynched.
Dead civilian with several gunshot wounds.
God… this is horrible.
All of the supplies from the truck are gone.
I hope those supplies will help people survive.
War
Before the war, we used to play jazz music and thematic broadcasts. The outbreak of war put an end to all that, and our radio started serving a much more important purpose. We realized that people’s lives and well-being could depend on up-to-date local news, and we decided it was our job to provide it.
Sniper Warning
Esma learned that the thus-far safe park had become the hunting ground of a sniper. To warn the people, we broadcast the news of this as soon as we could, hoping the bastard wouldn’t find out who compromised his position.
Supply Truck
Esma encountered a soldier whose supply truck had broken down. Risking the wrath of the soldiers, we passed on the news to the people, as the siege had deprived Pogoren of even the most vital supplies.
Lambs for the Slaughter
Esma learned of people in military custody, held in inhuman conditions, waiting to be brutally interrogated. We spread the word, and the rebels freed them. I dreaded to think what would happen if the soldiers found out it was our doing.
In the Crosshairs
The bartender from the music club warned us that Malik’s broadcasts had angered the military and that we were in terrible danger! Maybe we should’ve laid low instead of fighting for the truth?
Fearless
Davor asked us to use the radio to warn the rebels about the planned military attack on one of their important hideouts. We did it, despite the fear of retribution from the military.
Fearful
Davor asked us to use the radio to warn the rebels about the planned military attack on one of their important hideouts. We feared there would be retribution from the military, but we should’ve had more spine. Many people were killed that night.
Treachery Exposed
We learned the horrible truth that Novak, who used to be our friend, was selling names of Vyseni and their sympathisers to Grazni death squads. We exposed him and the rebels got him, but would they protect us if the soldiers came seeking vengeance?
Treachery Covered
We learned the horrible truth that Novak, who used to be our friend, was selling names of Vyseni and their sympathisers to Grazni death squads. We lied, claiming we didn’t know the informer’s identity in order to protect his son, regardless of how many other lives it would cost. We later learned that the rebels got him anyway. We don't know what happened to his son afterwards.
Dangerous Truth
Government forces shelled helpless civilians waiting for water at the old brewery. We tried to draw the attention of the international community to their crimes and the critical situation in Pogoren, even though the Grazni soldiers would hate us for it.
Dangerous Lie
Government forces shelled helpless civilians waiting for water at the old brewery. Fearing the soldiers would come to murder us if we informed people of it, we covered it up. We reported it was an accident used by the rebels for propaganda, but that was a disgusting lie.
Abduction
Despite all of Esma’s efforts to protect Malik, a horrible thing happened... A group of rebels, enraged by the lies in our broadcasts, broke into our house at night, destroyed our radio and abducted Malik! What would they do to him?!
Summary Execution
Our worst nightmare has come true, as a group of soldiers stormed into our home at night! The vile monsters destroyed our radio and summarily executed Malik! Our dearest Malik... Life would be meaningless and empty without him.
Malik’s Funeral
Many people came to Malik’s funeral to offer us their condolences and to honor Malik, who had been helping the people in every way he could and who had lost his life fighting for the truth.
The Search for Malik
We started the search for Malik at the music club, where we learned that Malik had been taken by the rebels. When they realized it was Esma who had been lying to him, they eventually let him go. Malik was shattered that she had betrayed him. Furious and disappointed, he decided he wouldn’t come back to her.
Stepping into the Breach
We managed to fix the radio and decided to continue Malik’s work of broadcasting helpful news and spreading the truth of the atrocities committed in Pogoren by the soldiers. Malik died defending the truth, and it was the least we could do to honor his memory.
Contrition
We managed to fix the radio. Contrite, Esma apologised to Malik on-air for all the times she lied to him, and for all the harm her lies had caused to the people of Pogoren... Would he ever find it in himself to forgive her?
Shattered
After Malik’s death, Esma was shattered and wracked with guilt. War took from her the love of her life, and with him, the reason to stay in Pogoren. When the boat reached safety, she hardly felt relief. She had nothing to look forward to.
Forsaken
Forsaken by her husband whom she had only been trying to protect, a broken-hearted Esma decided to risk escaping Pogoren by boat. When the boat reached safety, she did not rejoice with the others. Life without Malik would be hollow and grey.
Fuel at Gas Station
We informed the people that there was still fuel left in the cellars of the gas station. For a besieged city, fuel is a very precious resource.
Trapped Man
We came upon a man trapped in a collapsed basement. We couldn't help him ourselves, but we used the radio to ask if anyone could save him.
The door was broken in to get inside.
The guard was shot. It looks like it happened too quickly for him to react.
His throat is slit. Someone sneaked behind him and took him by surprise.
It seems there were casualties on the rebel side as well.
It was a bloody affair, but at least they rescued those people.
They got rescued. Thank God someone heard our broadcast.
Fresh Water at Old Brewery
We learned that drinking water would be available at the old brewery for the following couple of days, and we passed on this knowledge using our radio. Fresh water is difficult to come by in Pogoren.
Looks like there is a lot of fuel stored behind those bars.
Are you here to get out of the city? It's not cheap, you know.
Yes. I want to run away from the city with my mother, Esma.
After everything that happened with Malik... Nothing is keeping us here...
You're talking about Malik and Esma? Radio guys?
Yes... Esma and I want to flee the city.
Esma with her son... She's earned room on my boat for both of you.
Get on the boat when you're ready.
Malik? That radio guy?
Yes... Our story is over. I want to flee the city with my son.
Malik's wife... You've earned a place on my boat.
You can both go with me.
Get on the boat when you're ready.
Thank you!
This tragedy... It's difficult for both of us.
Soon it'll all be over, Mom.
I know... Wait a moment, Adem.
Captain, do you know when we'll reach the safe zone?
Hard to tell, ma'am. It looks like a storm is coming.
I'm looking for any decent forecast…
Soon it'll all be over, Mom.
I know... Wait a moment, Adem.
Captain, could you turn the volume up?
Sure, ma'am.
This is Malik.
Another day has passed. Another day of hardship and sacrifice.
We all have lost something in the war.
Our homes, our neighbors. Our loved ones...
But we can never lose our hope.
We have to stay strong and true to who we are.
Only this way can we can reclaim our freedom.
Only this way can our voices be heard.
This is Adem, Malik's son.
I am broadcasting again after the soldiers murdered my father.
He was brutally killed for sharing the truth with you.
But his voice will not be silenced. We will carry on his work.
To say what needs to be said.
Because we are your voice.
The Voice of Pogoren.
This is Esma. Malik's wife.
I am here to apologise to our listeners…
And to my husband.
I kept the truth from him. From all of you.
I lied to him because I wanted to protect him.
But instead my lies put him and many others in danger.
I hope that one day…
When all this is over…
I can seek forgiveness for my wrongdoings.
From my beloved husband. And you...
The people of Pogoren.
It seems to be the photo album Franko asked for.
Ceasefire
The war ended, but the tragedies of the people did not. Most lost their loved ones, their friends, their homes and their former lives. Esma grieved for Malik and blamed herself for his death. He died for his conviction, but she would never stop asking herself if there was more she could’ve done to protect him.
Ceasefire
The war ended, but the tragedies of the people did not. Most have lost their loved ones, their friends, their homes and their former lives. Forsaken by her husband whom she had only been trying to protect, Esma had nothing to look forward to. Her husband lived, but she lost him regardless.
Someone has recently broken through this door.
We are ready.
Ok. We'll be setting off soon.
Make yourself comfortable.
But all frequencies are silent.
The transmitter is badly damaged. We need to get special transmitter parts if we want to fix the radio.
We need to find these transmitter parts.
Esma and Adem can attempt to flee the besieged city. Do you want to try and leave Pogoren behind?
Yes, let's try to flee
No, let's stay
We have to get new transmitter parts if we want to broadcast a message to Malik.

Mom, are you all right?
I'm holding up… don't worry.
Are you sure? I know it's hard, but you have to hang in there! I need you.
Oh, Adem... I'll be fine. We need to fix the radio.
I'm not sure that's a good idea, Mom.
We should try to leave the city... I've heard there's a chance leave by boat. It's risky, but…
Please, Adem. Stop. I love your father... I need apologise to him. The radio is the only way.
Finally, we have access to our herb garden.
And we've gained more space for stuff.
Funeral
Our son, Adem, returned to us, but he was too late to save Malik. He helped bury his father.
Our Son, Adem, returned to warn us that the military was after us, but the rebels had already taken Malik.
Malik is with the rebels
I will try to listen for some useful information.
Diary that ends with a note from a week ago: "It's been really hard since Papa died. It's not easy for a woman alone. I notice how men look at me. Fortunately I met my school colleague from years ago, and he promised to look after me."
She lost her diary somehow...
Why? The world should hear about these atrocities!
Why are you taking photos? Help the wounded!
I will, but I need to document this massacre first.
We need proper evidence of this war crime.
I… Thanks for the warning.
It seems the pharmacy is as undersupplied as the rest of the city.
It’s much worse than I’d expected - they barely have anything left.
Your brother disagrees. He said this could put both of you in danger...
Are you threatening me?!
If the military finds out who snitched, they’ll kill us…
…and then they’ll come for you and your reckless husband!
This looks bad, I don’t remember the shelves here ever being so empty.
I won't attack those people.
Why would I do this?
I won't do this.
This doesn't make any sense.
I won't attack my friend.
He's a good person.
That's not what I'm here for.
We've known each other for a long time.
I won't attack any of the brothers.
I don't want to do this.
That's not what I'm here for.
Why would I do this?
I won't attack my old friend.
I won't attack Novak.
He has a son to look after.
I'm not going to attack Novak.
I won't hurt a child.
He's Novak's son.
I won't do this.
I won't attack Novak's son.
I won't attack a priest.
I'm here to bury Malik.
I won't do this.
The priest will help us with Malik's burial.
Why would I do this?
I won't attack my son.
Adem is my son.
I'm his mother.
I'm not here to attack anyone.
I won't attack anyone.
These people are safe here.
A church is no place for violence.
I won't do it.
I won't use violence here.
That's not what I'm here for.
Why would I do this?
I don't want to attack Gustav.
I won't attack my friend.
We've known each other for so long…
Gustav is my good friend.
I don't want to attack Gustav.
I won't attack him.
Gustav is our family friend.
Attacking him makes no sense.
He's the only person who actually knows something about Malik.
That would be stupid.
It's not a good idea.
I won't attack him.
I think we should stick together. I'm worried about you.
Don't be, I'll be fine. We can find him faster if we split up.
I'll go inside and ask if anyone heard about the kidnapping.
You could try to find out if people nearby have seen anything.
You're right. See you at home.
I won't attack anyone who survived this massacre.
I dont want to hurt anyone.
Haven't these people suffered enough?
That's a really bad idea.
Attacking the rebels would be suicide.
They will kill me if I try to do it.
I'm scared.
I won't do it.
We already have the most important parts. I need to check the diagrams at the workshop.
We have special transmitter parts. I have the diagrams ready at the workshop.
I should be able to repair the radio in our workshop.
The transmitter is broken.
We need radio parts to fix it.
I have to look for radio parts.
I need Adem to do it.
I need to ask Adem to help me with this.
Adem should help me do it.
I need Adem to do it.
I need to ask Adem to help me with this.
Adem should help me do it.
Poor man… I hope someone came to his aid. Alone in the dark, without food or water… That would be a horrible way to die.
I hope someone responded to our plea for help and saved that man from the collapsed basement. By helping one another, we retain our humanity.
It was very brave of the pharmacist to share his knowledge of the upcoming attack with us. He put himself at risk for the rebels’ sake.
Medical supplies are getting harder to come by, and it’s a blow that the pharmacy has almost run out. There has to be a way to get some more.
Siege or not, this is still our home.
Adem’s Return
Adem deserted the army and returned home to warn us that the military was intent on shutting our radio station down, but it was too late.
Adem’s Return
When Adem heard that the military was intent on shutting our radio station down, he deserted the army and returned home, only to learn that rebels had already abducted Malik.

Hey, Esma! How's it going?
What brings you here?
Go to hell...
Hey, we need to talk!
I need to have a smoke…

The boat reaches safety.
The international intervention arrives.
You've survived.
You've escaped Pogoren.
You decide to continue Malik's mission.
Shortly afterwards, the war ends.
Malik did not survive. The harsh reality of war proved too much for him. He would be remembered by the people of Pogoren as someone who had always brought them hope and fought for the truth.
Driven to desperation, Malik somehow managed to leave the shelter in order to look for help. He was shot, and died alone in the street. He would be remembered by the people of Pogoren as someone who had always brought them hope and fought for the truth.
Malik lost his will to live, and committed suicide.
The army, enraged by Malik’s broadcasts about their war crimes, sent a death squad to his door. He was summarily executed ‘for collusion with the rebels’, but would be remembered by the people of Pogoren as someone who had always brought them hope and fought for the truth.
After having forsaken Esma, Malik lived on to survive the war. When life began to return to normal, he tried to go back to hosting a morning radio program, but the war had changed him and made him too bitter for that. Instead, he found his purpose in testifying at the trials of notorious war criminals.
Malik survived the war, but could not forgive himself for abandoning his mission and became a bitter shadow of his former self, eventually pushing away everyone who had been close to him. He learned that his son died in the last days of the war, but never forgave him for enlisting in the government army.
Malik’s death broke Esma’s heart, but she found some degree of solace in continuing his mission with the help of their son. When the war finally ended, her radio station remained popular, because many people remembered how much help it had been during the siege.
Malik’s death broke Esma’s heart. She survived the war, but could never really find her own place in post-war reality. She became apathetic and would spend most of her time by Malik’s grave, relying on her son to support her.
Esma lived to see the end of war. Malik heard her apology on the radio, but he couldn’t forgive her for lying to him, and she never regained his trust. She could not undo what had been done, and she was wracked with guilt for the rest of her days.
Esma survived the war, but Malik never returned to her. Heartbroken, she became apathetic and could not find her own place in post-war reality. She spent most of her days staring into the distance, regretting that she had lied to Malik.
Esma lived to see the end of the war and continued looking after her husband in post-war reality, even though Malik had become withdrawn and sulky, always complaining how he should’ve done more during the war. Esma was shattered when she learned of their son’s death in the final days of the war. She would often visit his grave, though Malik never did.
After the war, Adem was pardoned for his desertion from the army. He stayed in Pogoren to look after Esma and aid her in running the radio, but he was greatly pained by the fact that he failed to reconcile with his father and returned too late to save him. If only he could turn back time.
After the war, Adem was pardoned for his desertion from the army. He stayed in Pogoren to look after Esma, who had been shattered by Malik’s death and seemed to have lost all will to live. Adem blamed himself, and was greatly pained by the fact that he failed to reconcile with his father and was too late to save him.
Adem survived the war and was later pardoned for his desertion from the army. He tried to reconcile his parents and begged his father to forgive him for having joined the army, but to no avail. Malik said that he no longer had a son, nor a wife.
Adem survived the war and was later pardoned for his desertion from the army. He begged his father to forgive him for having joined the army, and told him how Esma suffered after he had left her, but Malik replied that he no longer had a son, nor a wife.
Despite his military training, Adem did not survive the war.
Unable to cope with the tragedy of his family, Adem left the shelter. He was later captured by a Grazni military patrol and summarily executed for his desertion.
Unable to cope with the tragedy of his family, Adem commited suicide.
There's plenty of fuel in the basement of the gas station.
There's a man trapped at the toy store.
He really left... I will never forgive myself.
The War is Over.
You could've done much good, but chose to be silent...
I still imagine he's here, waiting for news.
Malik is gone, but I have to live for our son.
Maybe he'll come back one day. I need to have hope.
The house is so empty without Malik.
I need to get some information about Malik.
I should ask people about Malik.
I need to learn what happened to Malik.
I must read Malik's letter to Gustav.
Gustav has a letter from Malik. I need to read it.
I should read what Malik wrote in his letter to Gustav.
I should ask if anyone knows something about Malik.
I don't believe it... I must read Gustav's letter.
Pier 9... The boat leaving Pogoren should be nearby.
Esma hasn't found any useful information.
The Last Broadcast
I'll bring you some in a few days.
All right, thanks. Stay safe.
What happened here? Why are you taking pictures of those bodies?
These people were in line for water when the shells hit.
The army is full of nothing but cold-blooded murderers.
The whole world needs to learn about this crime.
Oh, it hurts so much…
Do you think we're safe?
It hurts when I try to move… I hope they won't fire again.
What happened here?
Ugh… I… don't remember much.
I was in line for water.
There was a blast… and I woke up all covered in blood, and everything was on fire…
Those bastards from the army shot mortar shells at us!
They must pay for this!
Hey! I want to ask you something.
I feel sick… but I have to find out what happened.
There are body parts lying all over the place. And some guys from the resistance are walking around and taking pictures. Where are the medics?!
More bad news… How much more will the people have to suffer?
I was hoping they at least had some supplies left.
Even the pharmacy has no meds. People must be told.
I have to warn the people that there is an informer among us.
Our listeners must be warned. Too bad we don’t know who the informer is.
There’s a traitor among us. Maybe someone will expose him when I mention it on the radio.
The people must hear about this unfortunate gas explosion in the brewery.
I need to broadcast news about the accident in the brewery. People might be looking for their loved ones.
People must be told about this tragedy.

Neighbour's House
A small house not far from Anja's cottage. The old man Tito, who was friends with Anja's parents, lives there. He became withdrawn after he lost his wife, but it might be worth it to visit him. Perhaps he can share some meds.
Maybe my neighbour Tito can help me.
The Samuel Institute
My neighbour Tito told me about the people who gathered here – helping each other and their community, sharing food with those in need, and handing out meds and other supplies.
Strange… It's so quiet here…
Construction Site
This construction site is a sad reminder of the Pogoren development program that this war interrupted. The abandoned structure might still hold resources necessary for our survival.
I hope I can find some fuel for the heater here.
Abandoned House
There are rumours about a group of bandits using this abandoned house as a hideout. It might be worth sneaking in for supplies, but you'd have to be very careful not to be spotted.
Maybe not all the useful things have been looted already… Let's have some hope.
Railway Station
Adam from the orphanage told us about this place when he asked for help evacuating the children from the war zone. He heard rumours that a group of people were working there to dig a tunnel out of the city. Maybe they could help us?
The last train left a long time ago. The one that was supposed to follow was bombed at the station.
Pogoren Museum
Milena asked me to join them in the Museum. Maybe it's not a bad idea and I should visit her.
Ok, now I have to speak with Milena
Supermarket
The shelled supermarket, even though it's commonly targeted by all sorts of scavengers, might still contain some precious resources. It's better to stay cautious when inside.
The store was looted after the bombing, but maybe I can still find something useful here.
Car Workshop
Before the war, this place belonged to the best car mechanic in Pogoren. Maybe he's still in business and can help us to find the parts necessary to fix the truck.
It seems quite calm in here...
Orphanage
A boy looking for fuel in the supermarket told us about a place for war orphans ran by a man called Adam. Things are bad there, so maybe we should go and see if we can help them?
Somewhere around should be the orphanage I heard about.
Petrol Station
Although the whole district has been heavily shelled, the petrol station is in surprisingly good shape. We might be able to find the parts necessary to fix the truck there. It's been looted as badly as all the other businesses, but people were mostly after food, cigarettes, and booze, not vehicle parts.
That petrol station seems abandoned.
Army Base
Colonel Markov is waiting for us at this outpost. He promised to let us through a mountain passage in exchange for a famous painting from our collection. We don't know if we can trust him though...
I have to be careful in this place...
A harsh winter grips Pogoren, making life in the besieged city even more difficult. People are trying to survive in the face of constant shelling, sniper fire, and starvation, but now also have to endure the extreme cold.</n></n>Anja was struggling every day to deal with those hardships when a man, dying from gunshot wounds and the cold, collapsed at her doorstep. She took him in without hesitation, hoping that one day he would get better and tell her what happened to him.

Children are Freezing
This harsh winter is more than I can manage on my own. We ran out of flammable materials to heat our place up. Andreas, the oldest one, has already got sick, and I don't know how much longer we can last under these circumstances. Can you help us out?
And dwarfs! Dwarfs are really funny, right?
I hope I'm not too late with this fuel…
These kids are strong, they should recover.
Andreas isn't getting any better. Did you manage to bring anything?
You might've heard me chatting with Nika, that little girl...
Please, Andreas is freezing...
She's really troubled and misses her mother.
Allegedly, there's a hideout somewhere near the main railway station.
I would check it myself, but I can't leave the kids alone...
Did you find any books in your museum?
Oh, they certainly are! I hope that book will cheer you up.
If you could find some books, that would be wonderful...
Books for Nika
Those children have lost so much in the war. Now they're losing what's left of their hope... They need something that can help them deal with their traumas and occupy their minds – maybe a lovely children's book will do wonders for their imagination.
I'll see what I can do.
Do you think you could find some books with pictures in your museum?
We did have some, but we desperately needed something to burn...
Who knows how long we can go before we run out of supplies.
A man told me about a group of people trying to flee from here.
What rumours?
There might be some hope though – I've heard rumours...
We're OK for now, but every day I wake up afraid for the fate of those kids.

I talked with Anja a little longer today. It was painful to go back to all that I saw in the synagogue and the Institute, but at least I can share this burden with someone who cares.
Anja kept safe the things I saved from the synagogue. They might not be very valuable as art, but they are unique and priceless for our community. Now, with so many of my people dead, saving the memory of them is my main objective. And things such as these are part of that memory.

The stranger needs drugs.
I must find medicine.
He'll die without meds!
It's getting harder…
I have to be strong…
Tito! Is everything all right?
I think I heard a noise upstairs.
I can't get there due to the bombing.
I can't get there due to the harsh weather conditions.
I'm running out of fuel too, but I'll try to figure something out.
You could visit the Samuel Institute. There are good folks working there.
A dead man lying on the floor…
And more bodies down there… Something terrible must have happened.
So many destroyed artworks and religious objects… Someone put a lot of effort into doing this.
Grandpa...
You know, when I grow up...
I'm going to be an artist. Just like you!
Ha! I bet you are!
Great talent runs in your veins.
And you've got a lot of passion, that's for sure!
Are you laughing at me, Grandpa?
Oh, Anja! I wouldn't even dare!
Actually, I've got something for you! Come, take a look.
What did you sculpt? Is that a horse?
Almost! That's a Vysenian aurochs.
Have you ever seen one of those before?
No, but I think I've read about it in one of your books!
Those au... aurochs used to live around Pogoren, right?
Oh, yes! On the steep slopes of the Vysenian Mountains.
They used to guide and protect our people for ages!
Then they became a symbol of our freedom.
Here, take it.
Can I keep it?!
Yes, it's yours now.
But you have to take care of it!
Just like the aurochs took care of Vysenis in the past.
Nenedian Vase
A bronze age vase of Nenedian origin. The Nenedians lived in what is today Graznavia and Vysena. They disappeared from the archaeological record during the period of great migrations, centuries before the first mentions of the Vyseni.

Warrior's Gear
The only complete set of early medieval Vysenian arms, unearthed in a warrior's tomb during archaeological excavations in 1953. The find, dated to the late 15th century, has significantly contributed to the knowledge of the military of this period.
Odkryty w 1953 podczas prac archeologicznych pochówek zbrojnego zawierał jedyny znany nauce kompletny zestaw wczesnośredniowiecznego uzbrojenia vyseńskiego. Znalezisko datowane jest na koniec X w. i w sposób znaczący poszerzyło wiedzę o sztuce wojskowej.
Vsebog Statue
This 11th-century wooden statue of pagan deity Vsebog is the oldest Vysenian artwork. Discovered in the 19th century, it became one of the national symbols, and even a cult object for the epigones of romantic neopaganism.
Pochodząca z XI w. drewniana rzeźba jest najstarszym zabytkiem sztuki vyseńskiej. Wykonana w okresie poprzedzającym przyjecie chrześcijaństwa przedstawia pogańskiego Wszechboga. Odkryta w XIX wieku szybko stała się jednym z symboli narodowych a nawet obiektem kultu epigonów romantycznego neopogaństwa.
Auroch's Skull
The majestic Vysenian aurochs (bos primigenius visenis) roamed the forests of Vysena since time immemorial. Hunting them was a royal privilege for centuries, but that didn't save them from extinction – the last aurochs was hunted down in 1602.
Stulecia temu tury vysenskie (łac. Bos primigenius visenis) dumnie przemierzały vyseńskie lasy. Prawo do polowań na nie należało wyłącznie do rodziny królewskiej, która korzystała tego przywileju nader skrzętnie doprowadzając do wybicia całego gatunku w roku 1602. Dziś jedynym wspomnieniem po wymarłych zwierzętach jest ta majestatyczna czaszka.
Town Charter of Pogoren
The original town charter of Pogoren, issued by King Eraric the Builder in 1312, granted the burghers numerous privileges, clearly favouring them over the other subjects. Documents like this were instrumental in cementing the Vyseni national identity and supporting Pogoren's claim to greatness.
Dokument ten przez wieki stanowił o wyjątkowości mieszkańców Pogoren i w wyobraźni Vyesnów wyodrębniał ich jako wspólnotę narodową.
The Casiodor Chronicle
A copy of a chronicle written by Casiodor, a Vysenian monk living in the 13th century. This late 13th or early 14th-century manuscript is the oldest surviving copy of the lost original but is unfortunately damaged and missing 30 pages.
Kronika vyseńskiego mnicha Kasiodora została spisana w XII w. Ten rękopis to jego najstarsza i jedyna kopia pochodząca z przełomu XIII i XIV w. Niestety egzemplarz jest poważnie uszkodzony i brakuje mu około 30 stron.

W okresie Złotego Wieku Vyseny kronikę Kasiodora wydano drukiem. Wydanie jest kompletne i zachowane w dobrym stanie. Nie jest też jedynym znanym egzemplarzem, obecnie w różnych placówkach w Pogoren zachowało się siedem kopii tego wydania.
St. Pantaleon Statue
This unique 14th-century statue is a work of renowned sculptor, Niko Getika. Born in Graznavia and banished for theft, he rose to prominence in Pogoren, where he spent most of his life and is considered a Vysenian artist.
Tę rzeźbę z XIV stulecia wykonał znany artysta Niko Getika. Mimo iż pochodził z prowincjonalnej Graznavii (skąd został wypędzony za kradzież) większość swego życia spędził w vysenskim Pogoren i vyseńscy patrioci postrzegają go jako vyseńskiego artystę. Wykonana przez Getika rzeźba św. Pantaleona jest unikalnym w skali świata dziełem średniowiecznej sztuki.
Prince Huneric's Banner
After the Battle of Drab Waters, large swaths of Graznavia came under Vysenian rule. Almost all the local nobles pledged homage to the new king, but the self-proclaimed Prince Huneric kept fighting until he died in a skirmish two years later. Today, he is a Graznavian national hero.
Po bitwie nad Burymi Wodami w 1441 znaczne połacie dzisiejszej Graznavii znalazło się pod panowaniem Królestwa Vyseny. Miejscowi władcy złożyli hołdy lenne nowemu panującemu ale graznavski, samozwańczy książę Huneryk kontynuował opór aż do swej śmierci w potyczce dwa lata później. Dziś dla Graznich jest bohaterem narodowym.
Dzieje przesławnego królestwa Vyseny

Lady with a Lilac Bouquet Painting
This painting by Amadeo Sangiovani, Renaissance master and contemporary of Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, is the crown jewel of the Pogoren Museum collection. It was created during the Vysenian "golden age" and commissioned by one of the kings' councillors, a woman who was alleged to be a favourite of King Rekkared IV.
Obraz renesansowego malarza, współczesnego Leonardo Da Vinciemu czy Michałowi Aniołowi stanowi perłę pogoreńskiej kolekcji muzealnej. Malowidło to powstało w okresie "złotego wieku" Vyseny zlecone przez jednego z królewskich doradców. Według legendy kobieta na nim przedstawiona to faworyta króla Rekkareda IV.
The Broken Sword of Rekkared II
After the victory at Drab Waters, King Rekkared II married the daughter of one of the defeated nobles. As a sign of his commitment to peace, he broke his sword over a stone altar during the wedding ceremony. Since then, this blade has been used during the crowning ceremonies of Vysenian kings.
Po zwycięstwie nad Burymi Wodami, król Rekkared II pojął za żonę córkę jednego z pokonanych, miejscowych możnych. Na znak, że nie będzie rządzić gwałtem i przemocą podczas ślubu strzaskał swój miecz na kamiennym ołtarzu. Od tej pory ostrze to służyło tylko w celach ceremonialnych i odgrywało kluczową rolę podczas aktu koronacji.
Ornate Vase, 13th century
In medieval times, Pogoren was an important pottery centre. The Potters' Guild controlled the manufacture of huge quantities of ornamented earthenware to be traded in the whole region. Despite its former ubiquity, Vysenian medieval pottery is becoming increasingly rare due to recent wartime losses.
Średniowieczne Pogoren znane było jako ośrodek rzemiosła ceramicznego. Cech Garncarzy wyrabiał olbrzymie ilości ozdobnej ceramiki przeznaczonej na handel w całym regionie. Mimo iż jeszcze do niedawna zachowało się wiele egzemplarzy średniowiecznej ceramiki to toczące się działania wojenne, a w szczególności wstrząsy wywołane ostrzałem artyleryjskim spowodowały praktycznie całkowite zniszczenie muzealnych zbiorów.
Chancellor's Edict
The extinguishing of the last Vysenian royal dynasty and the subsequent rule of Chancellor Respendial, who was of Grazni origin, brought about belated reforms. In an attempt to reunite the slowly disintegrating state, the chancellor extended the rights enjoyed by the Pogoren burghers to all towns and cities.
Wygaśnięcie rodzimej dynastii panującej i przejęcie władzy przez kanclerza Respendial (pochodzącego z ludu Graznich) zbiegło się z programem unifikacji powoli upadającego państwa. Kanclerz rozszerzył zawarte w akcie lokacyjnym prawa mieszczan Pogoren na mieszkańców wszystkich miast i miasteczek w królestwie, co spowodowało niezadowolenie tracących swą uprzywilejowaną pozycję pogoreńskich mieszczan.
Pogoren Confederation Articles
Chancellor Respendial's centralisation reforms caused much discontent, which led some Vysenian nobility and Pogoren burghers to establish a confederation in an attempt to restore their old privileges. This rebellion hastened the loss of independence, but the articles of confederation are nevertheless revered by many Vysenian nationalists.
Po wygaśnięciu dynastii panującej i przejęciu władzy przez uprawiającego centralistyczną politykę Wielkiego Kanclerza krajem wstrząsnęły liczne niepokoje. Szlachta wraz chcącymi bronić lokacyjnego przywileju mieszczanami wznieciła powstanie w obronie starych praw. Buntownicy wyłożyli swój program w tzw. akcie konfederacji. Mimo, iż rebelia przyczyniła się do utraty niepodległości to przez wielu Vysenów jest uważana za pierwsze narodowe powstanie, i z tej też przyczyny dokument ten otoczony jest wielkim szacunkiem.
Sceptre of Eraric II
Both sides of the civil war sought help abroad, and the neighbouring countries obliged, with the end result being the installation of a puppet king supported by Rufinia. The new ruler, related on the distaff side to the old dynasty, took the name of Eraric II and ordered a new set of regalia to replace the old one lost in the fighting. Only the golden sceptre survives to this day.
Podczas walk pogoreńskich konfederatów z siłami kanclerza ościenne państwa wielokrotnie na prośby stron konfliktu interweniowały w wojnę domową. Ostatecznie doprowadziło to do przejęcia władzy przez nowego, po kądzieli spokrewnionego z dawną dynastią monarchę. Nowy władca chcąc nawiązać do starych zwyczajów przyjął imię Eraryka II. Król ten zlecił też wykonanie nowych insygniów koronacyjnych (w miejsce zaginionych podczas walk oryginalnych insygniów) z których do dziś zachowało sie tylko berło.
Pogoren Governorate Statute of 1813
Eraric II's death marked the loss of Vysena's last vestiges of independence. The country was annexed by Rufinia, and a series of decrees subdivided it into governorates, establishing the administrative regions of Vysena and Graznavia.
Utrata resztek niepodległości po śmierci Eraryka II spowodowała włączenie państwa Vyseny do Rosji. Po okresie wojen napoleońskich nowe władze wydały szereg ukazów reorganizujących stan prawny ziemi dzisiejszej Graznavii.
Panorama of Pogoren, 1798
This painting by an unknown artist shows the panorama of Pogoren shortly before the loss of independence. Most of the buildings visible in the painting did not survive to modern times.
Ten namalowany przez nieznanego malarza obraz przedstawia panoramę stołecznego miasta w okresie bezpośrednio poprzedzającym utratę niepodległości. Większość budynków na nim uwiecznionych nie przetrwała do naszych czasów.
Songs and legends Manuscript by Janus Kun
A collection of folk songs and fables published in 1848 by the romantic poet, Janus Kun. Many tales feature fantastic beings like strigoi or vrykolakas. This is the original manuscript of one of the most important Vysenian literary works.
Zbiór pieśni i legend ludowych ostatecznie wydany w 1848 przez romantycznego poetę Janusa Morka. W licznych podaniach pojawiają się tajemnicze istoty z folkloru Vysenich takie jak strzygi (Strigoi) czy wampiry (Vrykolakas). Zbiór ten to jeden z najważniejszych pomników literatury Vysenów a egzemplarz ten jest oryginalnym rękopisem.
Pavel Valchanko, "Starożytności Vyseńskie" wyd. 1877
Praca historyka i vyseńskiego działacza narodowego w której to podkreślał obecność osadnictwa Vysenich na terenie regiony Pogoren od czasów Starożytnych. Samemu utożsamiając Vysenich z Nenedami krytykował graznavskich naukowców łączących starożytnych osadników z współczesnymi Graznami. Późniejsze badania zachodnich naukowców obaliły obie te teorie. W 1877 wydano 200 egzemplarzy Starożytności Vyseńskich do dziś w Bibliotekach zachowało się około 50.

Myra Belova's Diary
Myra Belova (1880–1918) was a famous activist fighting for the rights of Vyseni and women's suffrage. Her diaries are a priceless record of daily Pogoren life in the 19th century, and a sound socialist critique of the conservative beliefs of the Vyseni elite.
Myra Belova (1880-1918) była vyseńską sufrażystką i aktywistką narodową walczącą zarówno o prawa Vysenich jak i prawo głosu dla kobiet. Jej dzienniki zawierają opisy codziennego życia mieszkanek Pogoren w XIX wieku jak i stanowią socjalistyczną krytykę konserwatywnych poglądów vyseńskich elit.
A Tale of the Rosko Brothers' Collection
A famous collection of Marko Zlotnik's traditional fairy tales about two siblings' rivalry over a Graznavian princess. The family dispute described in the novel's pages ignites a spiral of madness and revenge that led to the division of the entire nation.</n></n>It's a beautifully illustrated classic edition with some handwritten notes in the margins that look like they might've been made by the author himself.
Old books we received for safekeeping
Pogoren Manuscript
This manuscript is a 19th-century forgery, most likely by the historian Ivo Makar, and created to prove that Vyseni wrote in their own language as early as in the 11th century. Some of the more fervent nationalists still believe in its authenticity and consider it a national treasure.
Ten dokument został wytworzony przez vyseńskiego historyka Iwo Makara, który chciał udowodnić, że Vyseni pisali dokumenty we własnym języku już w XI w. Choć większość badaczy uważa dokument za falsyfikat to część nacjonalistów uważa go za autentyk i skarb narodowy.
Archival Photographs of Pogoren
Prints and colour slides of Pogoren from the early 20th century. Most of the buildings pictured in them were destroyed during the war, so this collection remains the only material evidence of their existence.
Na wykonanych za pomocą kolorowych przeźroczy fotografiach uwieczniono pogoreńską architekturę z początku XX w. Większość przedstawionych na fotografiach zabytkowych obiektów została zniszczona w wyniku działań wojennych i zbiór ten jest najpewniej jedynym świadectwem ich istnienia.
Wedding of Rekkared II
After the victory at Drab Waters, King Rekkared II married the daughter of one of the defeated nobles. This marriage came to signify the dominance of Vyseni over the Grazni, and the reason why Vysenian painter Janosz Klaćko chose to immortalise the wedding in this huge painting.
Po zwycięstwie nad Burymi Wodami, król Rekkared II pojął za żonę córkę jednego z miejscowych możnych z ludu Graznich. Wydarzenie to stało się symbolem dawnej dominacji Vysenów nad Graznymi. Nie jest więc niczym dziwnym, że vyseński malarz Janosz Klaćko uwiecznił ten obraz na płótnie iście monumentalnych rozmiarów.
Sefer ha-Zohar, 14th century
Jews expelled from Spain at the end of the 15th century found refuge in many countries, including Vysena. They brought with them their holy books and scriptures, and among them, this ornate Kabbalistic manuscript. Almost all the Vysenian Jews were murdered during the Holocaust, but this manuscript bears witness to their centuries-long presence in Pogoren.
An old 15th-century manuscript that bears witness to a centuries-long Jewish presence in Pogoren.
Raport z starcie na Pijawczych Moczarach w 1849
(Leech Swamp report powinien być zmieniony)
Podczas Wiosny Ludów, w latach 1848-1849 zarówno Vyseni jak i Grazni usiłowali wywalczyć sobie niepodległość. Jednym z największych sukcesów powstańców Vyseńskich był atak na konwój rosyjskich żołnierzy zmierzający do Pogoren. Niestety sukces ten był ostatnim sukcesem powstańców i dwa miesiące później ich oddział został rozbity. Dokument ten jest nie tylko jedyną relacją urzędową ze strony rosyjskiej ale wobec faktu, że powstańcy ponieśli ostatecznie klęskę i zginęli raport ten jest jedynym niepodważalnym dowodem triumfu vyseńskiego oręża.
Political writings of Ivo Nadan
Ivo Nadan (1830-1911) was a distinguished Vysenian political thinker, considered one of the founding fathers of Graznavia, who in his writings forged the concept of modern Vysenian and Graznian patriotism. He lived to see his idea of common statehood realised, although his dream of full equality for both peoples remained mostly on paper.

War Crimes Documentation, 1941–45
Some Vysenians saw the German occupation during the Second World War as a chance for payback for the perceived injustices and discrimination against the Vysenian minority. This collection of folders contains previously unpublished documentation of war crimes committed by Vysenian nationalists who collaborated with the Nazis.

Materiał etnograficzny Górali z Pogorenia
Tereny Pogoreńskiego Pogórza od niepamiętnych czasów zamieszkiwała mniejszość o niesprecyzowanej świadomości etnicznej. Zebrany w latach 1922-1934 materiał etnograficzny służył do badania wpływów kultury Graznich i Visenów na tą ludność. Mimo olbrzymiej ilości zdjęć, analiz i opracowań autorzy nie byli w stanie odpowiedzieć czy ludność Pogórza to Grazni czy też Vyseni.

But this is my home… I would have to leave everything behind.
Only a part, but I don't know if I can keep the rest safe here anymore.
If you have some vegetables to share, I'd be very grateful.
And my collection has been damaged during a bombing.
Thank you. I'll think about it.
I don't know if I'm ready for it.
They want to break our spirit and erase our culture.
Listen – the situation is getting worse every day! The army is targeting cultural landmarks.
Did you lose everything?
I did, but with Ruben still recovering, I wasn't ready.
Are you safe here all by yourself? My offer still stands.
We have to do all we can. I'm sure your Grandpa would agree with me.
Take as much as you can and join me in the museum.
I suppose my Grandpa would want me to be safe.
And what could I do about it? I'm just one person struggling to survive…
I know you're collecting things in your shed, and I know I shouldn't ask, but…
They're helping our community, and used to help me from time to time
I did but… I don't think I'm ready.
I'm glad you're feeling better. Is there anything else you need?
Please, take some things from my desk. I know it's not much but that's all I have left.

Hello, Anja. Are you OK?

Oh, I'm sure. That's what brings me here.
Do you still have some of those pieces?
Well… I am, but… who are you?
Just please try to secure your family collection.
OK, I'll be passing by soon, I'll see what I can do.
Sounds like something my Grandpa would approve of.
What brings you here?
Forgive me, but I don't know you…
I'm trying to keep it safe it but that's not easy these days…
Our family collection… Yes, I inherited it after my Grandpa passed away
I guess you really had to be friends.
Oh no! You lost everything?
Anything would help me at this point… I was taking care of a wounded man, but he passed away.
I'll do my best, Milena.
I couldn't save him, not without food or medicine…
I'll do my best, Milena.

I brought you some meds and food for him.
You'd be safer there and you could help me secure the exhibits!

Killing my people, destroying our legacy…
First, I tried to reach our Institute… but the army was already there.
A soldier saw me and started shooting.
Didn't have a clue where I was… but I knew death was coming.
I wandered through a forest.
I ran… bleeding and freezing in the snowstorm.
I hope you get better soon. How did you end up here?
How are you today?
Sure thing. You better get some rest then.
Was he an artist?
Sorry to hear that.
You were here alone? Even before the war?
I'm used to being on my own… but it's actually nice to have someone around for a change.
My parents died when I was a little child. Grandpa raised me.
I hope you'll show me some of it when I get better.
But he passed shortly before the war.
Getting better, Ruben?
I'm used to being on my own… but it's actually nice to have someone around for a change.
A local one. He sculpted and painted, mostly traditional motives.
He was a very sensitive man with an artistic spirit.
At least he didn't have to see everything going to hell.
You must be Anja, am I right?
Next thing I remember was lying on this bed with you taking care of me. Thank you…
He left me with a great collection. It brings me many memories.
Last time we met you were just a little child.
I was a friend of your family back in the day.
Oh, sorry… you might not remember me. My name is Milena.
Oh yes… and I know that he assembled a nice collection of our local art.
I'm gathering pieces of our culture scattered across the shelled city.
I'm in charge of the Pogoren Museum. I'm trying to save our heritage for the future.
It's fine, why do you ask?
May this damned war end already... How's your collection?
I'm sure you did everything in your power to save him.
It's bad... but the worst thing is that I'm looking after a gravely ill stranger and I don't have any meds.
Hello! How are you going?
Trust me, I'll take care of your familly collection.
Trust me.. They will be safe in the museum
Maybe it's not a bad idea...
Okey, I'll come by the next few days.
I can handle it..
I brought the meds!
Thank you… but it's too late. The stranger has died. Maybe they'll at least help me to survive.
Your familly stuff is really valuable for our local community!
Maybe you changed your mind?
I want to ask you again about your familly collection.
Thanks.
Hi Anja, I brought some meds..
I can't give you, sorry.
Your grandpa was a distinguished artist... I'm concerned about the safety of his legacy.

Father's Watch
A Swiss watch that belonged to Anja's father. It was a reward that he received from Pogoren's mayor for his special contributions as a city planner. He thought the style of watch didn't suit a modest man like him but kept it hidden and safe as insurance for a rainy day.

Stranger's backpack
That's fine, I just wanted to help.
You're such a kind person. That's so rare these days…
Tito? Are you home?
I've already burnt everything I had.
I'll see what I can do.
Please... if you don't find anything...
… maybe you could spare some things from this collection? It's a matter of life and death at this point.
Tito won't survive without my help.
Maybe it's time to sacrifice something from my collection…
Tito needs fuel to heat his house.
The stranger needs some food.
The stranger is starving!
I have to give him something to eat.
This room is collapsing. It's not safe to work here.
I'm afraid the ceiling could fall on me.
This place is unsafe. I couldn't possibly work here.
It's so cold here.
It's so cold! I'm chilled to the bone.
We'll die if we can't heat it up soon.
I–I'm freezing here...
It's so damn cold... I won't make through the night.
I'll freeze to death soon.
I won't survive until the morning.
This cold... I can't feel my body...
I'm freezing to death here.
I guess the temperature could be a little higher, but it's OK.
It's pretty chilly here.
The temperature is almost perfect.
The temperature is perfect.
It's warm! That's certainly something to be happy about.

This is a story about those who tried...
Is my collection safe?
I put it safely in a box in our storeroom.
Please come to Museum and join us. We can provide you a better conditions...
Hi, I hope you didn't come to hurt us! We could use some help in here
Hi... You're one of those from the museum? Can you help me?
Good to see you!
There must by something we could burn in here...
I need to find some food.
Run to the safe place kids!
Hey you! Whats going on here?!
I see I won't get any information from you. You better leave. I'll give you 5 seconds.
Time's up.
Stay here, I'll talk it through.
I'm coming!
Bastard!
Hey, it's okay. It was just a misunderstanding.
Hey, are you doing ok? I'm trying to get us some fuel...
Are you all fine?
Hey, I'm happy you're all ok.
It's so messy... I need to to fix it.
Those broken walls are driving me mad.
I need to fix it all...
Hole in every wall... How can I keep those children safe and sound?
Oh no, no... please no!
Adam, Adam! Someone is breaking our furniture!
Thief! Thief in our home!
Ohh! Noo!
Someone is stealing!
Hey! You shouldn't mow in our things!
Uhh...
Hi! I've seen you keep your distance from everyone.
That's no good! You should spend more time with others.
Do you mind if I sit here with you?
...
Well... Okay. But please keep quiet.
Hey! Wait for me!
It's getting more difficult...
The memories of my family home make me cry so easily.
I should help them to secure the valuable items.
There's never enough food, medication, or bandages.
It looks safe here.
I'm incredibly grateful to Anja – she saved me.
I hope it will end soon.
I'm praying for my brothers and sisters every day.
I don't want to live my whole life in danger.
This place is all I have left.
We need to take care of this place.
These items are extremely valuable – we must protect them!
We've done everything we can to save these items.
My thanks to Milena for letting me in.
I'm not sure we should risk too much for these items.
I don't want to die!
I miss my family... I hope I'll find them.
These items are valuable to the people. I should help them.
These people seem OK.
I can't thank Milena enough for helping me after the bombing.
The bombs did more damage to my home than this place.
It's so unfair...
The people here are really nice.
These people seem OK.
We've been lucky.
I can see the bombs did some damage here.
The people living here look friendly.
It's good that we have extra hands to help.
Milena said she's fine, and I trust her.
No time to waste – let's secure the artefacts!
New company is always good.
It's good to see a new, friendly face.
I did… You live in the museum nearby, right?
I'm glad I could help. Do you need anything else?
Do you know where to find those people?
To be honest, that sounds unbelievable...
Don't worry, I might be able to check on it for you.
And there's a princess! And dragons!
The exhibits are in danger – we have to secure them!
Part of the roof is collapsing! We need to secure the items!
Part of the roof will fall soon! Quickly now, let's move these items to a safe area!
We have to move the artefacts to a safe area.
This room should be safe for some time yet...
The celling will last for some time, so let's secure these items.
We have some time before the celling falls.
I hope artifacts in basement are safe...
The water began to flood the lower level in the basement!
The water soon will reach the second level of the basement!
The water start flooding the second level of the basement! Heritage items are in danger!
We don't have much time to secure the items from the basement!
Water entered to the basement!
Flooding has started in the basement!
Second level of the basement is in danger!
We've to move arifacts from basement! They're getting wet
Artifacts in the basement are getting wet! Let's move them to safe area!
There is so much water in the basement! It's our last change to secure the artifacts!
The basement is completely flooded...
We lost the basement... There's too much water in there...
The basement is severed...
Grandpa's old workshop... somewhere I haven't been in a while.
And there's the toy aurochs he sculpted for me!
I'm not sure if we need to do this.
This is wrong... but I have no choice.
That was heavy.
Gone forever...
I'm not sure we need to do this...
Done.
This will be of some use at last.
Done.
I guess we have to do this.
Done...
We shouldn't be doing this. We have plenty of fuel...
That wasn't good.
We have to find something else to burn.
No way! I will not feed art into the flames!
Thank you for helping me... and for shelter.
Glad I could help. What counts is you survived.
How could I repay you?
Don't think about it like this... but I actually need any help I can get.
The museum is heavily damaged. The roof over the top floor of the right wing can collapse at any moment.
We must move the exhibits. We could also prop up the roof to buy some time.
Whatever you do, we must save these artworks. They're priceless!
Without them we would not survive as a people. Our identity would be destroyed.
I have to find a way to evacuate the collections somewhere safe. These walls are going to fall sooner or later...
I will do what I can to help, I promise.
Anja, I'm off to get the truck. Wish me luck.
I'm counting on you to protect the collection and secure the pieces which are in danger promptly.
I'll be back in a while... with a truck, hopefully.
May it come true. Good luck.
See you.
Help us, please…
Part of the orphanage was bombed and I need your help to make it liveable again. The children are freezing in the open right now, can you come with me and help us?
Thank you for opening the door!
Thank you... You might just be saving those kids!
OK, I'll try to find someone else... I should get going.
Oh... who are you?
Did you come to help us?
I'm scared...
You won't hurt us, right?
What are you looking for here?
Are you friendly?
Hello {mr|mister}{fr|miss}!
I hope we will be fine.
Oh, thank you for helping us!
Wow! I didn't know that!
I hope I will someday see such things.
This is so fascinating...
And one... two... three!
Wheee!
Wooho run!
Hahaha!
This weather makes it all even worse...
Winter, go away!
It's so cold... please, let it be hotter!
Where is my brother?
Mom... dad...

Milena offered us shelter at the Museum. </n>We could move there with some of our things and help her to save our heritage. </n>But with Ruben still in recovery, moving is very risky.
Pogoren Museum
Leaving home
Hi! I'm glad to see you alive and well!
Are you sure you want to move now? You won't be able to come back. You will take your family collection to the Museum.
I should make sure that Ruben is</n>well enough to survive the travel </n>through the blizzard and shelling.
My backpack… do you have it?
But I still see them…
Can you hear me?
I couldn't help them… My people… Friends… All dead…
Hello, Anja. Did you consider my offer?
Hello, Anja. Are you OK?
Please… can you keep it safe?
I saved it from the fire… Took as much as I could carry.
That's all I saved. Old manuscripts, my tallit…
Yes, it's safe.
Try not to think about it now, you need to rest.
Are you feeling any better?
City Documents
Old records of the Pogoren City Hall.
Stara dokumentacja z Pogoreńskiego urzędu miejskiego
But among all this destruction, there's still something completely intact…
I've been there… Still have the image of all the bodies in my head.
You got lost?
That was the least I could do… Have some rest now, Ruben.
I think so… But how are you dealing with all this?
I was wondering what it was but didn't want to go through your things.
You risked your life to do it.
Sure, I'll hide it. Now try to sleep.
My wound hurts… badly. When I was sneaking out from the synagogue…
Who? The army?
What happened? Who are you?
It's over, you're safe now. You need to rest.
I think so… I'm alive, thanks to you.
Started shooting… I hid in the back… Tried to save what I could…
They… came to the synagogue… with torches.
Another body and even more priceless artworks smashed to pieces. What a tragedy…
It looks like there's something that survived this attack…
More and more dead bodies lie among the total destruction. Many religious objects were intentionally desecrated.
Change Shelter
A damaged heater! Maybe there are some useful parts inside?
This is something special.
There's an impressive collection of Pogoren postcards and some classic vinyl records on the desk.</n>Tito put a lot of effort in to keep all this stuff in good condition.
Dear God…
It's terrible…
I just wanted to say that it's good to see you safe and sound.
We lost a friend in the last bombardment.
I'm sorry...
I heard what happened to your home.
The important thing is that you are all right.
I'm glad you're here.
It's terrible what happened to your house.
This war is an endless horror.
I was lucky to escape with my life...
I choose the cold over a guilty conscience.
This isn't fuel – it's our legacy.
I won't lend my hand to the destruction of art.
There has to be another way.
Oh, no... This is going to haunt my dreams for sure.
I can't believe I'm burning works of art.
Burning art to save lives... I fucking hate war.
If I don't do this, we'll freeze.
I have to do this. But it hurts so much...
Gone forever...
I wish we had a choice.
It's not like a book burning – we're saving lives.
I hate doing this. We must find fuel!
We shouldn't do this. But it's so cold...
This war has turned us into barbarians.
This is worthless, but should at least burn well.
This will warm some hearts for the first time!
Fortunately, we have plenty of useless art here.
Another piece of hack work to feed the furnace.
There's plenty more stuff like that here to burn.
Adam and his kids need some fuel.
We should help Adam and the kids from the orphanage.
Adam needs books for his kids.
We should help Adam and the kids from the orphanage.
Let's cross our fingers for Milena and her mission.
Milena is looking for a truck.
We have the truck, but we need to repair it.
The truck needs fixing if we want to use it.
Hi, I've interesting offer for you guys.
I can assume that you need some stuff to survive...
Incidentally, I have some much needed resources...
I can trade... for your exhibits of course.

My name… is Ruben. They killed us… All of us.
You… Thank you… for… helping me.
He's getting worse… His forehead is burning hot with fever and he's shivering all the time.
The stranger doesn't look good – he's unconscious and has a high fever. He needs medicine badly.
It's this stranger's backpack. I'm not going to paw through his stuff, but I noticed some religious items inside: a prayer shawl, a decorated candle, and something else. I think these might be of great value to him.
Colonel! Someone from the museum wants to see you.
Yes, sir!
All right, bring him in!

Milena's things
Get out of here. Now!
Are you fucking kidding me? I told you to keep it open!
Hey! Keep the door open!
My place, my rules. Respect that, or get the fuck out.
This manuscript means a lot to many people in Pogoren, including Ruben. At the same time, it might be the only chance to get the orphans out of the war zone.
Anja's necklace has been passed down through her family for generations. It can buy us the much-needed parts, but it's one of her last family heirlooms...
We promised to keep those books safe and hidden, but on the other hand, they can help the orphans deal with their trauma.
I won't hurt a child.
It's a child.
I won't do such a thing.
That's wrong.
Thank you. This food is the matter of life and death for us.
If I could pay you back somehow...
No, no... Just take it and feed those children.
I have to go... Good luck with everything
Be well kind man... Thank you once again!

Tito's Vinyl Records
A set of vinyl records. Tito, a true music enthusiast, collected many unique records over the years. The music of these long out of print albums reminds him of better times before the war.

I assume you brought the painting with you...
You must be one of those museum people...
I came to see the Colonel. He's expecting me.
Stop right there! Are you looking for trouble?
You're lying to me! You'll regret this!
I told you.. we don't have it..
And I know You have it! Give it to my and I'll guarantee the safety for you...
You know what i want... Location act of Pogoren!
What do you want?
I'll think about it, thanks.
Please join us in the museum... we provide you better conditions...
Anja's family were collecting objects of art in this shed for decades. Among them are unique examples of local Vyseni art and personal memorabilia of great sentimental value to Anja – and the last material reminders of her past.
[Otrzymujemy od Suedy leki]
I'll think about it, thanks.
See you!
Then maybe you'll change your mind.
You'll see how we taking care of those items...
Endangered room
Hi, would you be interested in some exchange?
What do you mean?
You're living in the museum... maybe you've some valuable items for exchange...
I can give you some stuff for a insignificant items.
A little exchange
I want one of your common exhibit:</n></n>1. Zbiór książek</n></n>[Musisz posiadac w glownej kolekcji (zabezpieczyc) ten przedmiot i go z niej ukrasc - akcja STEAL]
Flooding has been started
Room is going to collapse
Great, thank You!
See you next time...
I'll thing about it...
Ok, I'll wait...
So what's it gonna be?
I'll have the fire going in no time.
Thank you! You've saved Andreas and the other kids!
We're almost out of fuel and this cold is deadly.
Here’s what we have to do...
I’m going to take the truck through the mountain pass.
The Colonel is waiting for us there, and we can't trust him...
I’m not going to take that risk.
Thanks to you, we've found a different solution.
Even if we had to sacrifice things we didn't want to.
Because there's a lot more that needs to be saved.
But we can't forget who we're doing this for.
That’s why you should get back to the city.
The army will be looking for those items. </n>They'll be looking for you.
You have to make sure they won’t find anyone.
We have to make sure </n>our sacrifices weren't for nothing.
Because our mission was never just about saving our heritage.
In the end, what really matters...
Are the things we’re going to leave behind.
The vault is ready. Let's move your stuff in.
I should go with you! To help you!
No! You still have things to do here.
Thank you, Anja. Thank you for everything.
Hey, we should talk business.
Hey! Can I talk to someone?
We really should talk!
Come on... I need to talk to you!
I just want to talk. Open up!
Let's talk.
Can we talk already?
Hear me out! I won't stand here forever.
Good to see you! Let's talk.
Hi, I have another special offer for you!
And also have one question.
Did you saw in the museum's collection document called "Location act of Pogoren"?
I think we got it...
A little exchange
I want one of your more valuable exhibit:</n></n>1. Drewniana rzeźba Wszechboga LUB 2. Rzeźba św. Pantaleona LUB</n>3. Rękopis kroniki Kasiodora Mnicha</n>[Musisz posiadac w glownej kolekcji (zabezpieczyc) te przedmioty i je z niej ukrasc - akcja STEAL]
So what's it gonna be?
Great, thank You!
See you next time...
I'll thing about it...
Ok, I'll wait...
Ok.. now let's back to business.
Ok then... take it.
Thank you... I'll come soon with meds.
I understand... but maybe You will visit us at the museum?
A man collapsed on Anja's doorstep, dying from gunshot wounds and the cold. He is unconscious at the moment, but from time to time Anja can hear single words escaping his mouth. Whatever he dreams of must be truly horrifying...
Even before this war started, the life of an orphan was not easy. My parents died when I was just a little child, so I was raised by my grandpa. He was a great mentor, a local Vyseni artist who taught me everything I know about life and art. Since he passed away, I had to learn how to live and survive on my own. He left me with a small family collection that brings back memories of better days and gives me a ray of hope for tomorrow.
I don't know how I got to this house, but I can remember all too vividly everything that happened before… The massacre in the synagogue, my people being slaughtered by the army, the fire, gunshots, and screams. All we ever did was give a helping hand to those in need and support our community. I can only wonder why they came after us like that.
Hello! I'm glad to see you're better.
I need to talk to Anja. Could you get her, please?
Please... Help me!
My God! What happened to you?
Let's get you inside...
Somebody... Help!
So many memories...
I had a guest today. Her name was Milena, she's in charge of the Pogoren Museum. She seemed nice and friendly, and told me she used to be a friend of our family back in the day. She risks a lot searching the city under fire for art that's important for our culture. I'm impressed. I don't know if I could do so much to save our heritage in her place…
Milena visited again. She wants me to join her in the Museum and help her secure the exhibits. It would be great to help, and I might be safer there, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to leave everything behind.
Milena was here again to remind me of her proposal. She was very firm this time; it seems to me that she cares about the exhibits in "her" Museum more than anything. My situation here is getting more and more difficult. Moving with her might be my only hope.
I went to ask my neighbour Tito if he could spare some supplies. But he's actually in a worse way than me, freezing and starving in his small, cold house. He asked me for fuel to heat his place, but I don't have enough for my own needs… unless I start burning some old things from the collection.
There was a massacre in the Samuel Institute. I saw many dead bodies there, the priceless artworks smashed to pieces… These people were no threat to anyone, just a helpful community trying to find their way through this horror. Why did this happen to them?
The wounded man woke up today for a moment! His name is Ruben and he survived the pogrom in the synagogue. He's still very weak so I didn't learn much but once he gets better, I hope he can tell me more about what happened.
Ruben talked to me again about his escape from the synagogue and the massacre in the Samuel Institute. These attacks must have been coordinated; a cleansing targeted at their community. He managed to save some things and sneak them out in his backpack – they must be really important for him. I'd better secure them with the rest of my collection.
I was looking for supplies in the destroyed supermarket when I met this little kid. He told me about a man who's taking care of war orphans across Pogoren. I think I should check if I could be of any help to them.
That woman Milena came to visit us again. She wants Anja to join her in the Museum. It's Anja's call, but she's hesitating, saying she's not ready. I think she's actually worried about whether I would survive the move there…
Milena came by once again. She insists that we move to the Museum and help her protect Pogoren's heritage. It's up to Anja to decide but I'm afraid this might be our best chance to survive.
I woke up in a small house… a girl who lives in it is taking care of me. I don't remember how I ended up here but I'm really grateful to her for all she's doing. I must get better to thank her properly.
Hey kid, what are you doing all alone here?
I live in an orphanage nearby. Some kids there are falling ill as there's not enough food and meds.
An orphanage? Is there someone taking care of you kids?
Oh, yes... Our Papa Adam.
He gathered us in his tenement house and put a roof over our heads.
He's a good man, but it's not easy for him with all the problems he has to deal with.
Glad to hear somebody is taking care of you. But did he send you here all by yourself?
I'm the oldest kid there, so I'm helping to gather supplies when he has to stay with the others.
I see... Maybe there's something I could do for you?
You're so kind. Please visit us in the orphanage...
Talk to Adam, he could really use some help.
All right kid, I'll see what I can do!
I don't do it for the reward, but I'll try to help you. I hope you'll get better.
A wounded stranger collapsed on my doorstep. It was already hard for me to survive on my own, without having to provide for another person, but I could not leave him to die. I don't know who he is, but I feel I should help him anyway.
The blast damaged the shed, the roof is destroyed, and the walls partially collapsed.
Tito
As the collection grew, Anja's grandpa expanded his workshop to accommodate more works of art.
This girl… she's doing so much for me.
This bombardment could've killed us.
Memories of the massacre keep coming back to me…
My friends… my people… all dead.
Our house got hit during the shelling. At least nobody got hurt.
I failed to save the man… He passed away; his life slowly eaten away by the illness spreading from his infected wounds. I wish there was more I could have done but in these cold dark days I can barely survive on my own…
My neighbour didn't make it… He froze to death. If only I could have gotten to him faster with some fuel, maybe he would still be alive. I have to make decisions, the only other choice is to die, but living with their consequences is overwhelming.
It seems that Ruben is feeling better. He went through so much… I'm glad I could put a roof over his head and help him heal, but our situation is still very difficult.
Damn! I'm shot!
Don't run from me, you bastard!
What are you doing?!
Leave me alone!
Please don't hurt me!
Finally, I can heat my place.
Oh no, that thief is back!
Thank God that thief is running away.
Please, stop! That's all I have!
Oh no! My food…
The last scraps of food are gone… I'll starve!
I can't go on without food.
Thank God I have some food stashed to keep me going.
I'm warm and I have something to eat. There's still hope.
There's not much left in the fridge… but I have to eat something.
It's almost empty. I'll begin to starve soon.
It's finally warm in here, but without food, I'm screwed anyway…
Oh no! I've been robbed…
Why would you steal from me?! Go away!
Why are you doing this? Please, spare me…
Go ahead, kill me… I'll be dead soon anyway.
I have some things hidden in the cabinet. Please, take them.
You saved me in those dark days. I can't thank you enough.
Finally, I'm warm. Thank you so much!
An old mattress, some clothing, scattered personal things, odds and ends… Someone used to live here.
There are some papers and drawings among the scattered things, including a plan of the subway tunnels with handwritten notes.
These things look like they were scattered in a hurry. It seems that whoever left them didn't have much time to pack.
A plan of the tunnels? That's interesting…
I feel much better now.
With food and fire I might actually survive this war.
I'm so grateful for everything.
At least I can warm this place.
So hungry… I need more food to survive.
I'm better, but I won't make it without food.
I'm sick… I don't think I'll survive this.
It's freezing… I can't feel my hands.
I can't do it on my own…
You'll pay for killing our friend!
That's your last chance to leave! Get the hell out!
Damn! Where did {mr|he}{fr|she} go?
What the fuck?! Get the hell out of here!
Stop playing around, idiots! Someone broke in here. Help me find him!
We have an intruder inside! Hurry up and help me find him!
Fucking poker… I lost and now have to patrol this goddamn house!
I knew it! I went for a snack and felt we're not alone.
Relax, man. If you're right, we'll take care of him.
I lost again?! This deck must be marked or something!
Damn… I need a snack. I'll be right back
Do I smell perfume?
My mind is playing tricks on me. I've been too long without a woman.
Weird… I feel like there's someone here.
Damn, I hope this place isn't haunted or something
That damn glutton must have sneaked in here! Bastard ate our best food!
Ah, that hit the spot for me.
Where did he hide?!
I'm going to get you!
Where the fuck did he go?
You thought you could spy on us?
Show yourself now and I might let you go!
You're a dead man already!
Hey! I remember having at least 20 more chips when I left!
Hah, you wish! You lost them trying to complete your gutshot last turn.
Whatever… I'm not going to argue with a dabbler.
How about we switch to Omaha Hi-Lo?!
Naah, you wish… I wanna play the other one you showed me yesterday.
Without the common cards, where you have to get the smallest cards of different colours!
You mean Badugi. Sure, I can beat your ass in that one too!
In your dreams… Now I'm the dealer every turn!
I don't trust your sneaky hands and your shuffling!
Fine by me. I'll win anyway
It's cold down there…
Oh no! Where's my Aurochs?
He needs to eat something!
I think he's not hungry anymore.
My collection got hit in the bombing.
At least we didn't get hurt by the bombs.
Thanks to Anja, I'm getting better.
I feel better with every passing day.
I would be dead now if it wasn't for Anja.
I can't believe I'm doing this.
I had to burn Grandpa's treasures… I wish there was another way.
You… Thank you… for… helping me.
My name… is Ruben. They killed us… All of us.
They… came to the synagogue… with torches.
Started shooting… I hid in the back… Tried to save what I could…
I couldn't help them… My people… Friends… All dead…
Can you hear me?
What happened? Who are you?
Who? The army?
It's over, you're safe now. You need to rest.
Ruben is strong enough to move
The stranger regained consciousness
The stranger woke up today from his tormented sleep. He is conscious.
Ruben got out of bed today. He's eager to help in the daily struggle for survival.
The stranger is dead
Anja couldn't help him. She found him dead this morning.
The shed roof collapsed
The shed roof collapsed during the bombing. We need to secure part of the collection.
My house was destroyed in the last shelling…
You move around the city a lot. What did you see?
The army lobbed plenty of mortar bombs from the hills.
Mostly at the centre, but some landed in the suburbs.
I didn't peek out from my shelter the whole night.
Bloody murderers! They don't care who they kill!
They want to break us, scare us into submission.
To force the Vyseni into surrendering the capital and accepting Grazni rule.
Do you think it's possible to destroy the identity of the whole people?
I don't know… I'm just trying to live, day by day.
How is the situation in the city?
This harsh winter is driving people to the edge…
Well… it seems to be harder than ever.
The army attacks are more frequent and brutal every day.
You mean the bombardments?
Not just them, the soldiers have started to enter the city now.
They're carrying out cleansing raids, targeting churches and other important places.
Last night, the city hall fell. It was turned into ashes…
That's terrible… How long can our people carry on like this?
Honestly? I don't know… it's really bad. People are freezing and starving.
Soon I won't have anything to trade – or people to trade with.
Backpack filled with some ceremonial items.
Items saved by Ruben from a synagogue.
An item saved and brought from a destroyed institute.
A set of items kept by Tito in his house.
We should take some supplies with us.
Our house got hit tonight
The heater needs more fuel when it's so cold.
It's so cold! We could freeze if the heater isn't fully stoked.
I have to keep the heater fully stoked
I'll have to stoke it later.
That should be enough for now.
I'll stoke it if the temperature goes down.
This damned bombing seems much more intense today.
I think I can hear more explosions today.
Damn, I need to heat this place!
It's too cold. I need to get the heater going.
I'm freezing… It's hard to work in this cold.
I'm freezing… It's too cold in here.
I'm too cold to do it.
It's so cold… I can't do it.

Anja! I'm so glad you changed your mind.
I know it must've been hard to leave your home behind.
Trust me, you're much safer here! And you can do a lot of good for our city.
It was even harder than moving through Pogoren with my collection.
I see you brought some of your things with you…
I still have a lot of doubts about my decision.
I took as much as I could fit in the cart.
But having to push it through the snow didn't make it any easier.
What counts is that you made it and we can start working.
Come with me, I'll show you around.
Anja! I'm so glad you changed your mind.

We took as much as we could fit in the cart.
But having to push it through the snow didn't make it any easier.
What counts is that you both made it and we can start working.
Leave it here for now and come with me
Anja! I'm so glad you're here!
What happened to your friend? Is he…
He's gone… He didn't make it.
He was too weak… I shouldn't have talked him into moving here.
I'm sure you did everything in your power to keep him safe.
You can't let such thoughts keep you down.
I took as much as I could from my house.
Maybe it'll be of some use…
That's great, Anja. We'll take care of it.
Now let's go, I'll show you around.
I'm going to show you what we're doing here.
Sometimes it's still not enough. Don't be too harsh on yourself.
But maybe if I'd kept him home, he would've recovered…
Think about what you can do for the people still out there.
Come, I'll show you what we're dealing with.
This is our Main Warehouse. It was used to store old documents and archives.
Now, we try to gather all the most important and endangered pieces in here.
This looks impressive!
Decades of history must be stored in these papers.
You can check our main exhibits in the catalogue later.
Now come, there's so much more I need to show you.
What they're doing here despite the war is truly amazing.
Let's go to my office. There's a lot more you need to see.
This is my office. Feel free to enter whenever you need.
It's where you can usually find me. If I'm around, of course…
You can also check our current list of tasks that need handling here.
First, I have to show you the most important space in the whole building…
We have a lot of work to do. Let's go upstairs.
These offices had to be full of people before the war.
This wing was hit really bad during the bombardment.
We must reinforce the structure, but we lack people and materials.
It doesn't look good… Do you think it will hold?
I can only imagine how these hallways must've looked filled with visitors…
In the end, the museum is and always was for the people. I'll show you our main wing.
Not for long. We have to reinforce the pillars to buy us more time.
We have to collect and secure all the exhibits and documents in these rooms.
What do you do with those items later?
We keep them in the Main Warehouse until we can find a better solution
Now come, there's one more thing I need to show you.
I'll leave you here for now. If you have any questions, you can usually find me in the office.
This part of the museum is our exhibition space. Or what's left of it…
There are still some items left on display, the others are packed in boxes in the back.
I'm sure you know the painting we're looking at right now…
Yes… This famous painting and your family's collection are important in the same way.
They make us who we are. Please remember that…
Of course, it's The Battle of Leech Swamp – a commemoration of a great victory.
All Vyseni know the story and this painting.
Yes… I brought you here to show you the importance of what we're doing.
The value of this painting is extraordinary. Many people would like to put their hands on it.
But for our people it's priceless! Like many other exhibits in the museum.
Our heritage…
This painting reminds me of something…
So, Anja… are you enjoying our little trip?
Of course! This museum is huge!
I think I've already been here long ago…
This whole place is so big…

It's like ten of our houses!
Ha! Indeed, kid, but tell me…
What do you think about this painting?
I love it! It has knights and horses!
But do you know who these knights are?
Um… Are they Vyseni?
Oh, yes! Our proud cavalry in the famous Battle of Leech Swamp.
It's one of the glorious moments from our past.
A time when we were still a free and proud nation.
You know, Grandpa… I think…
When I grow up, I want to be a knight!
Hah! You don't want to be an artist anymore?
Well… As a knight I could fight for Vysena with my sword!
Oh sure, my child. But you see…
You don't always need a sword to fight.
You can win with nothing more than a brush in your hand.
I'll leave you for now. If you have any questions, you can usually find me in the office.
The Battle of Leech Swamp'
A famous Miroslav Rotejko painting from 1869. It depicts the great victory of the Vysenian army over Graznavii raiders in the Battle of Leech Swamp. Created over two decades later, the painting become a symbol of freedom for the Vysenian community, which had lost its independence at that time. It is Rotejko's magnum opus and a work of art well known all over the world.

Hello again, Anja. How do you feel about your new home?
I'm still adjusting. I guess I need more time to get familiar with everything.
Sure thing. You can talk to Zoran if you haven't had the chance yet.
He can tell you more about living here and our mission.
Thanks. You know… when I was upstairs,
I realized that I'd been here before.
A long time ago, with my Grandpa.
Oh, yes. He used to visit us from time to time.
He was a kind man… Such a delight to talk to – a font of tales from all over Vysena.
I miss him so much. Right now more than ever…
Of course. Everyone who knew him does, but you know what?
I'm sure he would be proud of you and the decisions you've made.
Thank you. I hope you're right.
Hi! I'm Zoran.
Well, it wasn't an easy decision to make.
I'm really happy that you finally decided to join us!
But I hope we can be of any help to you.
Hah, sure thing you can! There's plenty to do.
We're sorting exhibits and documents. Securing whatever we can.
It's just two of you doing all this work?
Just the two of us. And Milena is often out.
She wanders all over Pogoren, trying to save as many artworks as possible.
That sounds incredibly risky…
Oh, you bet it is! But… Well, that's Milena.
She'd give anything to protect our heritage.
Even her life?
That's what she's like. You'll see when you get to know her better.
She can be haughty and blinded by her mission at times.
But she's a really good person, and she's trying to do the right thing.
Don't worry, Anja. I'll be fine.
How are you feeling? I was afraid this trip might be bad for your health.
How about you? I hope you don't regret your decision.
Well… It's certainly overwhelming at the moment.
Leaving home, moving in here… and all the challenges still ahead.
I think I need more time.
Get some rest Anja. You deserve it.
I feel well enough to help you with your work.
I should make sure that Ruben is well enough to make his way through the blizzard and shelling.
Ruben might be well enough to survive the journey to the museum.
I'll leave my home and move with the family collection to the museum.
We've found another person with some precious and important items. It's Anja – the granddaughter of an old friend of Milena's. She lives by herself in her old family house and has a small collection that's been gathered over generations. We should really provide her with some help.
Our building was hit hard again. We need to think of a way to secure the exhibits outside the building, but first, some kind of transportation is required. Milena has a plan to use some of her contacts and find us the necessary vehicle.
A special set of books have been handed to us by a concerned woman. Maybe people don't bring as many things here as they used to at the start of this war, but moments like this remind us of the significance of our mission. We have to make sure those books are safe in our museum.
A woman that brought us her collection of books came back today and asked for the books back, only to find that we don't have them anymore. She got furious, and maybe her reaction was vicious and inappropriate given the circumstances, but it reminded us all that maybe it wasn't our decision to make.
There are some unsecured documents and papers from our old archives in the basement. They're not in danger right now, but given the current circumstances, they should be moved to the main storage room.</n>
We've managed to secure all the documents and other things from the basement. The knowledge contained in hundreds of pages of historical documentation will be safe and secure when it's all over.
The right wing of our building was badly hit during the last bombings. It's mostly former office areas, but there are still some exhibits and documents being stored there. We need to secure them as soon as possible, as the structure looks weakened and may not last for long.
We've managed to secure all the items from the top floor in time! They're now safe in the main storage area.
The last floor of the office area collapsed during the night. There wasn't much more we could do, but now we need to focus on reinforcing the structure of another floor.</n>
All the items from another floor in the right wing were secured before the structure collapsed. It's good to see them mostly unharmed and now in a safe place.
Another floor in the office area collapsed last night. While there wasn't much we could do to stop it, the good news is that the structure below it seems to be rigid.
Our main exhibition space was hit in the bombing last night... That puts the whole main exhibition, with all of the most precious items, in jeopardy. We have to secure those items fast, starting with the areas most at risk.
Don't worry about me. We'll see each other soon.
The whole rooftop over the main exhibition space has collapsed. We could do nothing else against such a force.
The main structure is getting weaker every day, and another floor started to collapse last night. We need to hurry with securing the exhibits.
Another floor filled with exhibits is secured. The items are safely waiting for evacuation in the main storage area.
Another floor collapsed last night, and the main structure is continuing to fall apart. We need to hurry with securing the spaces underneath.
Another floor is falling apart. Thee concrete pillars can't withstand the load of the collapsed structure and rubble above. We have to make sure everything is secured.
The last items in the most at-risk areas have been secured. We've managed to put them together with the rest in the main storage area.
Another area that was at risk fell apart. Thankfully, the structure underneath seems to be withstanding the load for now.
We've learned of some orphan's gathered in a building close to our museum. There's a man named Adam there that takes care of them, but he definitely needs help. Maybe we should pay them a visit one night to make sure they're OK.
The children at the orphanage are not feeling well. They're getting sick from the cold as they are out of fuel to heat their place. Adam, who looks after them, isn't able to leave the orphans alone and asked us to bring anything to heat the building with. We could possibly offer some of the less important documents and papers, but wouldn't that undermine what we're trying to achieve here?
We had to make some sacrifices, but the kids finally have something to warm themselves up. They still have a lot to deal with, but at least they're not freezing to death.
We've managed to secure all the items from the exhibition space on the top floor. It's good to see those items are safe and protected now.
Adam from the orphanage has asked us to bring something for the kids that could take their mind off the everyday struggles and the inevitable sorrow that follows. We have a beautifully illustrated collection of books that's been brought to us, and that set of books would be much more useful in those the hands and hearts of those children than on our storage shelves. But we promised to keep the books safe. Should it be for us to decide their fate?</n></n>
One of us took the set of books to the orphanage. They may be better off with the kids, but we did promise to keep safe and evacuate all of our heritage items. And those have now gone back out into the besieged city again...
Adam from the orphanage told us a rumour about some people living in the tunnels. It's apparently possible to meet them in an abandoned railway station. The people there are trying to reach an old grid of tunnels that could lead them out beyond enemy lines. We should check it out. Maybe this could be a way to evacuate both the kids and our exhibits.
There really are people trying to reach the old tunnels under the city! Unfortunately, we won't be able to use them to evacuate our exhibits as the tunnels are too narrow and we don't have enough people or time to take all the items with us. However, we could help the children to escape the city, but it comes with the price... A man from the tunnels asked us to bring him the Sefer ha-Zohar – the most important item left from Ruben's community...
The Sefer ha-Zohar has been given to the people from the tunnels. They promised to help Adam and his orphans once they're ready to leave the city. At the same time, we've lost one of our most important items that had been kept safe through wars and hard times in the past. Now it might be lost forever...
Milena came back with a truck today. She barely made it to the museum, as it's barely working and almost out of fuel. Now, we need to figure out a way to repair it, find the proper parts, and get some fuel for it ready for our evacuation.
A shady guy who's living in a car workshop has the engine parts that we need, but he doesn't want to give them away for free. He's requested some jewellery, preferably gold, as it's something he can sell easily these days. If we want to get the truck working, we'll have to sacrifice something from our collection.
We've got the parts we needed to repair our truck. Once we fix it and the fuel tank is filled again, we should be ready to evacuate.
We were able to fix the truck with the engine parts picked up from the workshop. With the tank filled again, we should be ready to evacuate.
We found enough fuel at the petrol station. Once everything's fixed, and Milena is back, we'll be ready to evacuate.
The situation in the city is getting increasingly more dangerous, and we have to find a way to evacuate as soon as possible. Milena is once again trying to reach some of her old friends and contacts to figure something out. In the meantime, we should prepare and secure everything in the museum.
Our building got hit again during the bombings, and we have to start thinking about moving our things somewhere else. But first, we need to find a vehicle we can use to load up and move everything.
An army officer came to our museum with an offer. He asked us to give away the most famous Vysenian painting, The Battle of Leech Swamp, in exchange for so-called 'protection'. He claimed that he finds destroying our cultural heritage barbaric and that he's acting against direct orders, but his proposition sounded like a threat to Milena.
After the Colonel paid us a visit, Milena decided to hide the painting in case he ever came back. The next time he comes with an 'offer', he might not be alone...
Milena left the shelter of the museum for a while, and the Colonel came back. He once again talked about handing him the painting in exchange for a safe route. Milena strongly refused to talk with him before, but she'll be out for some time looking for a safe way out, and this might just be one being handed to us... Either way, the Colonel is waiting for one of us at an army base – and we shouldn't show up without the painting.
The painting was handed over to the Colonel. In exchange, his troops stationed at an exit route from the city should let us through with the rest of our exhibits. We have to wait for Milena to come back and make a decision on whether we should risk taking that route or not.

A Graznian soldier in our museum! I hoped this day would never come…
Yes, my name's Milena. What brings you here?
Hello! I don't mean to bother you but… do you run this place?
The word on the street is that you help with… keeping things hidden.
I guess that depends what kind of things we're talking about.
All I'm interested in is gathering artworks important for our culture.
We must preserve them for future generations.
Oh, that's great! Here, take these books.
Wait… These are old and beautifully illustrated – and valuable.
My Papa used to read these tales to me when I was young.
My house has been raided twice already… The bandits didn't find them then, but I can't take the risk anymore.
If I survive this war, maybe I could take them back. But for now, please keep them safe.
All right, don't worry. I will keep them safe for you. Take care.
Thank you, dear! Thank you and God bless you!
Those books are extremely rare. It's good that she brought them here.
Hello… is Milena here?
I haven't seen her for a few days now. Can I help you?
I left my old books with her. She promised to hide them for me.
I'm trying to flee the city by river today and I wanted to take my books with me.
Well… We don't have them here anymore.
What? What do you mean?!
Please, don't worry! They're in better hands now – we gave them to the kids at the orphanage.
Those books can do wonders to help them forget about the war. At least for a while.
How… how dare you! Those books were my ticket out of the city!
That was my last resort! You promised to keep them safe!
I didn't promise anything to you.
But… but Milena did! I'll tell everyone…
I'll them that you're all just a bunch of white-collar thieves!
Oh, yes. She brought us some old books to hide.
I saw you talking with that woman today…
Does that happen often? People bringing their stuff?
Well, it used to, after the first bombs fell. People were trying to save what they could from the fires.
It rarely happens now. I guess there's not much left to save…
I'm beginning to appreciate even more what you're doing here.
We do what we can. And you're a part of the team now.
Colonel Markov. I'm looking for the person who runs this place.
I suppose that's me. Are you here to destroy our museum?
The last remains of our culture that we've managed to save from you?
Don't worry. I'm here to talk.
Besides, if my superiors knew I was here, I'd be in as much trouble as you.
And you expect me to believe you?
Oh no... It seems that she was slowly losing hope here...
You should go now. The guard outside will walk you out.
Do you know what orders were issued to our troops?
Are you proud of that, Colonel? Did you come here to brag?
It's true, the army wants to wipe out everything of any significance to your people.
Destroy all traces of Vyseni culture in the city.
Would you mind walking me through the exhibition?
I don't feel like I have much of a choice.
Oh, but you do! There's always a choice.
I'm a soldier and I understand the cost of war.
But destroying a whole culture? The precious monuments built by generations?
Come in!
I can help you. I'm your only way out of this city.
I still don't understand why you keep coming here.
The plan is starting to work out.
And I guess using it isn't free.
Everything has a price. This one is well worth paying.
So what's your price, Colonel?
The Battle of Leech Swamp.
You must be joking. What would you do with the most precious Vysenian painting?
You see, my troops are stationed on the road out of the city…
I know people who'll pay a lot of money for it.
As I said, there's always a choice – one painting to save all the rest.
And what's stopping you from just taking it right now?
My superiors want this place burnt to the ground. With all its contents.
Yes, sir!
I can't just take it, I'm being watched. But if we're clever about it… we could both benefit.
I hope you bring good news.
Think about it. I'll see you soon
I'm going to beat your ass.
It's empty!
Fuck!
Where are all the things?
I will burn your fucking museum to the ground! And I don't care what or who is left inside!
There's nothing more you can d–
I have to go now.
What do you mean? You promised we'll be safe…
Listen… The museum was hit again last night.
It doesn't change our plans, we just need to speed them up.
I know, and I will keep my promise!
But we need to evacuate. This building won't last long.
Evacuate? With all these artworks?
And where are we supposed to go?!
I've got a plan, but I'll need your help.
We need a truck. I know somebody who owes me a favour.
He could help with the truck, but first I have to find him.
Are you leaving us? What are we going to do?
Just keep preparing the exhibits for evacuation. And try to keep the museum from collapsing.
I'll be back soon. Just… don't lose your faith in what we're doing. Please.
I was wondering, do you run this place?
No, Milena's in charge, but she's not here at the moment.
Do you want to wait for her?
Well… Listen, we're trading small talk here.
But you might have something that's worth a lot to me.
We could make a nice deal. Help each other...
Our exhibits are not for sale.
All I'm looking for are some old case files. They're worthless to you.
But those papers could be very useful to me.
What case files are you looking for? And why?
But she's not here, is she? Think about it.
Did you guys think about my offer?
Why do you even care so much about some old papers?
Tell me one thing first. Let's say we give you those documents...
Family matters. I need to talk to some people.
In the meantime, make sure you've got the papers I need.
Hand over these papers to you? Right here, in full sight?
I don't think you really have much of a choice...
We can finish our trade there, under cover of darkness.
No... Meet me at the Construction Site nearby. Away from prying eyes.
And you expect me to do what exactly in exchange?
It's not safe in here when the city is surrounded by soldiers
I've got everything set for you. If you have my papers, of course...
You could move your collection there and keep it safe.
Those papers could help me find those people.
I've got a safe place. I'll be back soon to give you more details.
You want to track them down... just to talk to them?
And how would you do that?
Look, it's between me and these people.
What you should be concerned about is your collection.
Keep it safe with you? Why should we trust you?
There are some old bank vaults underground – I've got access to them.
For the information inside those files, I could really help you...
It's not safe here. The army is moving closer, and I could help you out.
I heard knocking... Wait here kids.
Don't worry... I'll check on it.
Car Workshop
We can fix the truck here.
A set of beautifully illustrated classic fairy tales by Marko Zlotnik, with handwritten notes on the sides that look like they may have been made by the author himself.</n></n>Those can be quite valuable, so we've been asked to keep them safe in our collection as their owner won't be able to hide them by herself.
You can have it almost for nothing.
It's quite common, being honest.
It would cost you...
You'd have to show me A LOT in exchange.
Very common stuff, not very interesting.
Nothing special, but not bad either.
I don't need that.
Interesting. Wanna exchange?
Exactly what I need! I can give you a lot for this!
You've gotta be kidding. Show me some more.
It won't do, try harder.
Fine, we can have a deal.
It's very generous of you.
This offer of yours is just too damn impressive.
It wasn't easy to get here. I hope you'll appreciate that.
It's tough, but neighbors should help each other.
Let's cut to the chase and trade.
Show me what you wish to trade.
What can you give me for that?
What do you want for this?
Ah, you must be one of the people Andras told me about!
I'm glad I could help. I heard about your orphanage.
He said he met someone kind at the supermarket.
I live in the Museum nearby and thought I should check on you.
How do you cope?
Well, you know the older boy you met, Andreas?
Nobody has it easy these days, but providing for all these kids...
He used to? What happened?
Anything to heat this place is essential right now.
You said you could use help with something?
You see, these kids have lived through some terrible shit…
Something like toys or books?
I'm looking for anything that could distract them, even for a while.
Books would do wonders to feed their imagination.
I need to think about it, Adam.
Or in the kids' hands?
And where will they be more useful? In an archive?
They belong to the whole community.
I actually know of some books like that, but… they aren't mine.
It'd be great if they could get some hope from a few tales.
Books would do wonders to feed their imagination.
Something like toys or books?
I'm looking for anything that could distract them from their suffering, even for a while.
But they've been badly hurt by this cold… and by many other things before.
It'd be great if they could get some hope from a few tales.

And where will they be more useful? In an archive?
Or in the kids' hands?
I need to think about it, Adam.
They're using some old mining tunnels that lead outside the city.
You brought some books! Thank you!
Oh, yes! The world in those pictures – I would love to live in it!
And maybe later Adam can find some time to read me those tales!
We're freezing in here...
Help us please
I'll do my best
Will this war ever end?
I dream about warm bed...
We have a chance now. We must get on with the evacuation.
The situation in the city is getting worse as the army is moving closer every day.
You really did it, Milena!
Not yet. We must prepare first, pack everything, and…
This truck is a mess. We have to fix it and find some fuel.
Are you saying we have to leave now? Again?
And what next? Do we know where we're going?
That's the worst part. I'm still figuring it out.
But for the time being we need to get as much as we can on our truck.
Just some spare parts – I need to fix my old truck.
You! What are you looking for here?!
Everything has a price in this world – and during war that price is considerably higher. If you need my help, bring me something nice, precious, and easy to trade. Good old gold is the best currency nowadays!</n></n>
Gold Rush
You know where to find me if you change your mind.
Because I like gold! Anything shiny is the best investment these days.
Bring me some and we can talk about your auto parts!
This necklace means a lot to–
Here are the parts. It's been a pleasure doing business with you.
Yeah, yeah that's not really your problem anymore.
Did you get me something nice?
Looking for auto parts in a car garage? And you came across a car mechanic!
What a coincidence! Here, take whatever you need!
Um… really?
Of course not! You want parts, you have to pay!
Well, I don't have much…
I'm a simple man and I'm fond of simple things. Like gold!
What do you want for these parts?
Friends used to call me Crow. You know why?
Because you caw?
I'd say be well but… you know how it is these days.
It's you again! Did you come to see Bertie?
Who are you talking about?
Colonel
My car, of course!
There are two loves in my life: my car and good old–
Gold?
Hah, that's right, smartass! Nothing could hurt my lucky Bertie.
She's survived two bombings and a raid.
It seems like you two have a… special connection.
We do! Once the war is over, I'll give my Bertie a glorious repaint.
Let me guess… you'll paint her gold?
You bet I will!
What are you talking about?
Listen – please don't panic but…
Is this some kind of a joke?
Oh no! Whoever did that's going to pay!
I think something happened to Bertie.
And you stay here! Watch my closet until I'm back!
I just saw someone trying to lift Bertie's hood.
I won't let you get away with my property!
That's enough! I'll give you one last chance to leave.
Oh no! It was a set up!
Bertie! I'm coming!
The coil… the filter… Who did this to you!
Stop, you fucking thief!
Stop, you fucking thief!
Who the fuck do you think you are? Get the hell out of here!
I knew you couldn't be trusted! Leave – while you still can.
Hurry up, asshole. Get out!
I need a smoke… Don't touch anything!
I've got my eyes on you! Don't close the door!
Damn it, I need another. I was about to quit and now I'm chain smoking!
You can join me outside if you want.
I hope you changed your mind because I don't like wasting my time.
I'll make sure it's in good hands.
I sacrificed a lot to bring it here – I lied to people who trust me!
Please tell me it was worth it and that you'll keep your promise.
The mountain pass in the south is an exit route secured by my soldiers.
That's your way out. My soldiers will let you through.
How can I be sure that you'll keep your word?
You don't really have a choice.
Now go! Before anyone gets suspicious.
I'll give you more time – but don't try to test me!
Wait there.
Stop right there! You have nothing to look for here.
Get lost!
What are you doing? I didn't say you could go in!
What are you doing? I didn't say you could go in!
As I said, take {ms|him}{fs|her} to the Colonel.
Officer! Walk that Vyseni to the Colonel.
You can go in now.
Stop! Take one more step, and I'll shoot you!
Explain why you're here, or I'll take you for interrogation.
You'll pay with your life for what you did!
This is your last chance to leave in one piece!
You'll pay with your life for what you did!
This is your last chance to leave in one piece!
That's enough! You got me.
Hey! Get out of there, quick!
We've got a fugitive!
I've had enough of this! I'm not a fucking babysitter!
I told you to stay outside!
I told you to get lost!
There's a back exit over there, you should go now.
Where are you going? I thought you wanted to see the Colonel?
Hey! Stay close.
Damn it! Stay close, or I'll make sure you regret it!
Hey you! Stay in sight.
OK, I'll walk you out now.
You'd better stay close – and don't test my patience!
Come on, let's go.
Sir!
Time to raise the blinds, amateurs – 25/50, no ante.
I fold.
Oh!
What a loser. He should really quit that "white magic" stuff.
OK, I call.
Ah, fine... All in.
Come on... One time!
Fine, I raise to 200.
Oh! What a flop! All right, let's bet 1200 for now.
Call.
Ace of hearts on the turn. You've got four outs with a gutshot.
Of course... Queen of spades on the river.
Fucking fish... That's the third suck out this evening!
Ah, that's enough, I'm too tired to play. I need a walk.
Fine! You asked for this!
Damn! You'd better not do that again!
Aah! What the hell!
You should stay close to me.
Shit! I've lost the trail.
I don't know what you're thinking, but if you want to go, I'll escort you.
You're leaving? I thought you wanted to talk with the Colonel?
What the hell you think you're doing? Get down, now!
Hey! Stay close.
You two! Stop fighting right now!
Eh... all right. I'll walk you to the Colonel's office.
Come on, let's go.
Stay there! I'll let him know you're here.
Don't test my patience! Stay close.
Stay in sight!
Don't move any further!
You can see the Colonel now, he's waiting for you.
What the...? I just made a fool of myself...
If you came to see Milena, she isn't here.
We've considered your offer, Colonel, and we're not interested.
And did you consider the gravity of your situation?
My orders are clear – everything you see around you will be destroyed.
This place will be burnt to the ground. You will lose everything that you're trying to save.
We'll see about that. Milena has devoted her life to saving the museum.
And she will lose it, and who knows what else.
You can find me at the Military Outpost. My soldiers will let you in.
My offer stands – bring the painting with you and save the whole collection.
Don't let this madness destroy everything you care about.
Don't shoot! I'm from the museum. I just want to talk…
We extended an old network of stone mining tunnels.
Months of planning, weeks of work underground…
Sorry about Goran. He can be a bit too… eager.
I don't give a damn about what you want. Get lost!
Give me just one minute! You're digging tunnels, right?
You want to get people out of the city…
I'm warning you for the last time! Stop snooping on us!
I… I want to make you an offer. Please – hear me out…
I don't make the decisions around here.
Then could you take me to someone who does?
Damn… All right, but I'm warning you…
One stupid move and you'll never see the sun again!
And now that we're finished, you just want to jump on board?
I'm not doing this for myself.
And I'm willing to give a lot for it…
You dug all these tunnels?
It underlies a large part of Pogoren.
And where's it going to take you?
We hope to breach the caves south of the city.
That would take us safely beyond the enemy lines.
Tell me, what brings you here?
I'm looking for a way out.
Hah! Who isn't?!
Not for me… for the children.
They're orphans, and they won't last long in this city.
Children… Who wouldn't help them, right?
I guess we could smuggle them but…
But you want something in return.
Correct! You live in the Pogoren museum, right?
I've heard of many precious things kept there. But there's one in particular…
If you're talking about The Battle of Leech Swamp…
Oh, hell no! How would I smuggle it through the tunnels?!
But the Sefer al-Zohar manuscript… Now that's the real jewel in your museum's crown.
Bring the manuscript to me and I will help you.
Splendid! You did your part, and I'll keep my promise.
I'll send one of my people to let you know once we're ready.
We'll leave at night, so prepare your kids.
Ticket to safety
Although not many know about its existence, and even fewer about its meaning, the Sefer al-Zohar manuscript is probably the most valuable item in the whole of Pogoren. It survived countless wars and has a long and wondrous history.</n>If you bring me the manuscript, I promise to help you smuggle the children out.
That's it! Get the fuck out!
That's all right, Goran, I'll take it from here.
You're going to pay for this!
Oh no, what are we going to do?!
Someone's going to pay for this!
What the hell? Who is this?
Get lost, I'm busy.
Aah! What the hell!
Hey! Get out of here. Now!
Fine! You asked for this…
Fuck it, that's enough!
I told you, go away!
Stop wasting my time.
Are you leaving? I thought you wanted to see my boss?
Damn you! Don't you dare do that again!
Hey! Keep close.
You! Stay in sight!
Sir, someone from the museum urgently wants to talk with you.
Sorry about that, sir. It seems this person might have something for us.
Don't lag behind. I'm not a patient man.
Come on, let's go.
Shit! I saw someone there.
Who the hell are you?
You're wounded, Milena… I'll get help.
We did what we could to save it.
Everything you've built…
I hoped this day would never come...
It doesn't matter… I got shot in the street but… I found a way to save the collection.
I got us a deal. Not a perfect one, but it's the only one we have.
Our painting, The Battle of Leech Swamp… do you have it?
It's on the truck but the army is looking for it. This colonel…
His troops guard the only way out of the city. He's obsessed with this painting.
Listen – I made a deal with Taras. He'll hide the collection in an underground vault.
Taras… You think we can trust him? What does he get out of it?
The painting… it's his final offer. He's got buyers for it…
I've protected this painting… and now you want us to give it away?!
I don't want to! But there's no other way…
Here's what we have to do…
You're wounded, Milena… I'll get help.
It doesn't matter… I got shot in the street but… I found a way to save the collection.
I got us a deal. Not a perfect one, but it's the only one we have.
Our painting, The Battle of Leech Swamp… do you have it?
I… I gave it away… The army was looking for it.
Colonel Markov promised to let us through the southern pass!
We can't trust him! He's a shifty guy, I've heard stories…
But he already got what he wanted!
No… People like him always want more. We can't take the risk.
The southern pass is our only chance. We must take it.
Here's what we have to do…
That should last for some time.
The whole city is surrounded! Where do you want to go?
I'm leaving again. Please pass my message to the others...
I need to find us a way to evacuate from here.
We'll take care of everything when you're gone
Over the years, I've developed some contacts.
It's a long shot, but we have to take it...
Please Milena, be careful out there...
In the meantime, you have to prepare everything for our departure.
Last night, Milena found out about our National Library being bombed by the military. It's good that the Safer ha-Zohar manuscript was handed over to the museum shortly before the war. So many other precious manuscripts and rare books were turned to ashes when the building was set on fire. Some people tried to form a human chain to extract the most valuable things, but the side street was in view of a sniper's lookout. He shot some people dead, and the rest scattered in panic. Will the same thing happen to our museum?
After the attack on an old church last night, Milena decided to visit other cultural buildings across the city. Some old documents were handed to her in a nearby synagogue, but most of the precious items were either already in the museum or were ceremonial and required to stay inside.
Rumours about a massacre at the synagogue reached us yesterday... The army didn't bomb the place. Instead, troops came in to kill the people inside and set the place on fire. They even went to the nearby Samuel Institute where many innocent people were hiding... Milena went to see if there was anything left inside, but she didn't manage to find anything among the ashes and corpses. Either the soldiers took everything with them, or scavengers raided the place in the aftermath.
The Grazni army are targeting cultural buildings in the city now, no matter the associated religion or beliefs. They want to break our spirit. A church was hit during morning mass, and some of the people who died inside had lived through wars in the past. Just like the old church, they had witnessed and survived wars before. But not this time...</n>
Ruben told me that many people had risked their lives to save that manuscript in the past.
My people have risked a lot to save it over the years. I'm glad to see it safe here.
There are stories about the Sefer ha-Zohar manuscript passed on within our community. It survived the Second World War hidden in a basement and became a symbol for outlasting in the toughest of circumstances. I'm glad it's being protected here.
How did you end up in the museum Ruben?
After seeing the Sefer ha-Zohar being secured here, I feel that what we're doing really matters.
It meant a lot to whole generations, and many have risked their lives to protect it.
I'm happy to be a part of it now.
We should talk about the Sefer ha-Zohar. About the offer.
I'm sorry Anja, but for me, there's nothing to talk about.
That manuscript was protected for decades. Many risked their lives for it.
I'm not going to stop you. Anja.
And it can help us in saving others. Those are kids...
But the day you take the manuscript from here will be the last day you ever see me.
Dear Anja,</n></n>I told you that the day you decide to take the manuscript would be the last day you ever see me, and I meant it. I couldn't live with myself, thinking that I had taken any part in it. I'm writing this letter so that you know I understand your decision, even though I strongly disagree with it. You've risked a lot to save me, and I understand that you want to do the same for others. I will always be grateful for your help, and I truly hope that you'll be able to save those children. And that the sacrifice you've had to make won't be wasted.</n></n>Ruben
I can't believe Ruben left...
Ruben left without even a goodbye. Did we cross the line?
All Ruben left was a goodbye letter...
Milena has been gone for a few days now... I'm starting to worry.
Milena still hasn't come back yet. I'm beginning to wonder if she ever will...
What will we do if Milena never comes back?
Something terrible must've happened to Milena.
I'm really worried about Milena.
Milena's been gone for days, and it's unlikely she'd leave the museum and us for so long if nothing bad had happened to her. We should probably start thinking about a backup plan. The situation is bad, and one day we'll have to evacuate one way or the other.
I'm starting to worry about Milena.
She would never leave us here alone for so long.
Something must have happened.
I think we need an evacuation plan in case she never comes back.
We should prepare things for sure, but she will come back. She must...
She's tough, and no matter what's happened, she will be back.
Moving to a new home and leaving the old one behind was not an easy choice to make, but now I'm here, I can see the importance of what Milena is doing. The amount of work she and Zoran have to do in order to save the achievements of past generations for future ones amazes me... I'll try to contribute to it as well as I can.
Anja was concerned about moving here, but she looks relieved now we've managed to arrive safely with our things. There's a lot of work to do, but I'm glad things are being saved from the massacre and protected here.
It's good to see someone joining Milena and me in our duties. Milena often had to go out to the city, which in most cases meant I was alone with all this work. It's not that I want to complain, but getting more help with my day to day work brings me new hope for our mission.
We've learned about a group of war orphans and a man named Adam who takes care of them in his old house. Being an orphan myself, I'd like to do whatever it takes to help them...
There are some orphans in our neighbourhood that could use our help, and I see how much that means to Anja. She did so much to help me, just a random stranger, and I'm sure she'd do the same for the others.
If there are people in need, I believe others should always help. But there's a war going on, and we've got a lot of work... What we're doing here isn't for us but for the generations yet to come. I don't know if we can afford to shift the focus away from our main goal...
The situation with the kids at the orphanage is worse than we thought. They're freezing there, and Adam needs to stay all the time as the kids are falling sick. They really need help.
For me, it's not a difficult thing to imagine how a freezing person feels as I was there too not long ago – and I don't want those kids to suffer the same. We need to help them.
Kids dying of cold... What a horrible and disgusting thing. If the war and loss of their relatives were not already enough, now they have to face the idea of death themselves. Our work in the museum is important, but something has to be done about those kids in the meantime.
I'm so glad we could help those kids before something terrible happened. They might need some time to recover, but they should be fine for a while.
An image of those kids freezing to death would have haunted me for years. We had to do something about it – and we did it just in time. It's good to see how happy helping them makes Anja and manages to take her mind off the everyday troubles we need to face.
Thank God we managed to help those kids in time! I was hesitant at first, but if anything would've happened to them, I'd have been blaming myself for the rest of my life...
It's good that we finally helped those kids, but I hope it wasn't too late and they'll be fine. They just need to recover now.
We had to do something for those kids at the orphanage, and I hope it wasn't too late. An image of those kids freezing to death would haunt me for years.
Thank God we managed to help those kids, and I pray that it wasn't too late! I was hesitant at first, so if anything worse happens to them now, I'd blame myself for the rest of my life...
Dealing with trauma and loss of those close pours sourness and darkness into a kid's soul. I know that feeling very well, so I want to help those orphans every way I can. A little girl named Nika asked for a book, something illustrated, like the books her mother used to read to her. But that would mean sacrificing one of the things we're trying to protect here...
Those kids from the orphanage went through so much... I can easily understand them asking for something they could derive some hope from... But we're here to protect things and keep them safe, not give them away and risk losing them forever in a besieged city
I want all the best for those orphans, I wish them a quick recovery, and I hope they finally find peace and new homes after the horrible war. But giving away things from our collection? That I can't agree with.
Little Nika couldn't have been happier about the books she was given. One could say we should have kept those books safe in the Museum, like we were told to... But on the other hand... Who are we saving those items for if not for kids in need, like Nika?
I swore to secure and protect our heritage, not give it away. I understand those kids are in need, and I'm sure those books will be useful in their hands, but I just can't deal with a decision that was made behind my back...
Maybe those books should never have been taken away from the Museum, but at least they landed in the right hands... Kids can use them, read them... If they could for at least one moment think about something other than their losses and tragedy, then maybe giving those books away was not a bad thing at all.
We've learned about something that brings hope for all of us. Apparently, some people are trying to escape from the city. We should try to reach them. Maybe we could help evacuate kids using those tunnels?
There's a light at the end of the tunnel for us – quite literally. It's a long shot, but if we manage to find the people escaping the city, if they even exist, maybe we'll all be safe.
We've learned about the people in the tunnels, but if there's one thing my life has taught me is that you should never have your hopes raised too high. Crushing high hopes is incredibly painful, and I've felt that too many times before.
Another part of the building is collapsing! Everything we did with Milena, all that hard work might turn into a pile of ashes buried beneath the rubble if we don't speed up securing the items. Thank God I'm not alone with all this anymore.
Working in the Museum wasn't really my dream job, but it was nice, calm, and paid my rent. Milena was also a great boss who was devoted to her work. It all changed when the war started, but not Milena. I decided to stay there to help her out, even though my back's hurt and I can't do as much as I used to each day. I just truly believe in Milena's mission and wanted to be a part of it.
After the massacre at the synagogue, I find myself shivering when I see a military uniform. That Colonel guy makes me anxious. I really don't know what to think about his offer, but there's something off with him, something that makes me uneasy.
That shady Colonel paid us a visit – what brazenness to threaten and blackmail us like that! He's clearly not loyal to his command, and to me, we're nothing without loyalty.
We handed the painting over to the Colonel... I wish there was any other way, but without Milena, we have to make decisions on our own. Maybe this can secure a way out for us and the rest of our collection.
We had to take action and decided on that painting's fate... Milena isn't coming back for a while, and we're stuck in a building that's falling apart. Maybe this way, we can at least save the items we have left.
The painting's gone – I couldn't stop it. All I can do is continue my work and hope we can save the rest without having to sacrifice anything else.
There are people in the tunnels, and there is some hope! We won't be able to transport our items through tiny tunnels, but we can use that route to rescue children from the orphanage. The people in the tunnels have one condition though – they want 'Sefer Ha-Zohar'. Probably the last item Ruben would ever want me to sacrifice... That makes the decision even harder than usual.
There's a chance for the kids, as we could all escape through some tunnels. But it would mean giving away one of the most important manuscripts to me – to my people! I can't agree to that... I understand Anja. I know she wants to help, and I will be forever grateful for that, but I won't help her do this...
There's a way to help the orphans escape the city, but it would mean handing over one of our most precious and important items in the collection to some shady men. I want those kids to be safe and out of this hell, but I don't agree that this is our decision to make. The heritage we're protecting, the collection, it doesn't belong to any of us, and we can't decide on the fate of those items.
I secured a way out for the orphans – if those people in the tunnels keep their promise of course... But the consequences are difficult for me to bear, as Ruben left with only a goodbye note as an explanation. I saved him, only to crush his feelings so hard that he felt he had to escape...
We got hit again last night... This is war, and what's worse, I'm starting to get used to it. The constant running away, praying for my life, living in hiding... I once even caught myself thinking that I don't remember what it was like to live without fear, without the need to escape.
Another item was taken by Anja last night... I just hope that when this war is over, someone will be able to track down the things we couldn't protect and bring them back where they belong.
We were supposed to be safe in here, but now it seems like the whole building is collapsing and we have to figure out a way to escape with our things. I don't have time to think about it much though as we have too many things to save.
Nothing was ever more important to Milena than her work and the museum – that's why she wouldn't leave for so long without a reason. I can only hope that the reason now is not because something bad has happened to her...
Everybody is starting to worry about Milena. According to Zoran's story, she never left the museum for more than few days at a time. Maybe she feels it's safe with us, and that she doesn't have to come back before finding a way out?
Milena is looking for a truck. We need it to take the exhibits somewhere safe. But where exactly? We don't have a plan for that yet, and we already have a lot of work to do in the museum.
While Milena is looking for a truck we have to focus on securing the exhibits inside. The situation in the Museum is way worse than we thought before we decided to move in. But at least we have ourselves and a sense of purpose.</n>
I'm honestly concerned every time Milena goes out to the city, and now she has to find us a vehicle for the collection. She was my employer, but she's also my friend, and I pray every day that nothing bad will happen to her.
Milena is back, and she found a truck! Considering how convincing she was in trying to get me here, I had no doubt she would succeed. It's now time for the next step for all of us.
It's good to see Milena in the museum again. Every hour spent on the streets of Pogoren is extremely risky, so I was obviously worried, but with Milena here again, we can now focus on our next moves.
It's great to see Milena back – and she found a truck! It always amazes me how good she is at getting things done.
Once Milena gets back to the museum, we can start the evacuation. The truck has been fixed and refuelled, we just need to finish our duties with the exhibits, and we'll be ready to go.
We had to make some tough choices and sacrifice a few things, but it looks like it might still pay off. We've got a truck set and ready for when we know where to go.
The truck's fixed, it's fuelled ready to go, but the most important element is missing – Milena. She still hasn't come back. I'm really worried too because she never goes out for so long without informing me.
Milena has been gone for a few days now... We're all worried, but what's worse is that we don't really know what to do once everything is set. Should we go on without her? How long are we supposed to wait?
Everybody seems to be concerned after the Colonel's visit... Indeed he made an offer that seemed more like blackmail than an honest preopostition. But at least he didn't come with fire and a whole unit behind him....
Wait! Help!
Milena! Come on, truck! We have to go!
Hey stranger, can you see the light?
The pain is gone... I don't feel it anymore.
The light is bright, and it's getting closer.
I don't feel anything anymore.
And I finally don't remember.
The light is good. It's calm.
I can feel it. I can touch it.
You should touch the light with me...
All pain is just a fragment of the past!
It's there!
Great! Thank you, Milena.
Your collection will be safe with me now.
I will burn your fucking museum to the ground! And I don't care what or who is left inside!
I thought we had a deal!
But we'll have to take that risk.
Maybe there are things we shouldn't compromise...
You need to take as many things as you can with you.
If we lose, somebody has to tell our story. </n>Go, find and gather what's been lost...
You did whatever you could. Now go!
Did you bring the documents, Colonel?
But there are people waiting for your help.
Can we stop the car, Anja?
We should be far enough from the fire.
A Vysenian national treasure, and maybe also the only way to save everything else. Can we even consider it?
I'm just stating the facts.
Milena gave you some meds.

They're fine. I left them alone for a while, but I had to get to you.
Adam! What are you doing here? Is everything fine with the kids?
Listen... There might be some hope – for all of us.
What do you mean?
There are rumours... Rumours about people trying to escape the city!
They're using an old network of tunnels underground that leads outside the city.
To be honest, that sounds unbelievable...
Do you know where to find those people?
Some say there's a hideout somewhere near the main railway station.
I would check it myself, but it's on the other side of the city...
I can't leave kids alone for that long.
Get back to them. I'll see what I can do.
The army is regrouping – they're changing positions.
I haven't seen you for a while now.
How is the situation in the city?
Even more snipers are being placed on the lookout.
Maybe that's why the bombings have stopped for a while...
It's like the calm before the storm.
Well, one thing is certain – we'll hear the mortars again.
Rumours are that they're preparing for a big move.
We'll be prepared.
You should leave! Places like this will be targeted in the first wave!
We can't leave now. Not until our friend comes back.
She brought us here, and I won't leave without her.
Hello, I'm Maria. Milena sent me here.
Maria! Did you bring any news about Milena?
But we'll be prepared for the worst-case scenario. Thank you.
Is she all right?! We were getting worried.
She's alive, but got caught by the military.
She's being held in a military warehouse.
What! What happened?
Soldiers caught her stealing safe-conduct papers for cargo.
The poor woman... She told me what you were doing here and why she needed those papers.
She was trying to find a way out for us and the collection.
How did you talk to her? Do you know how to reach her?
I work in the warehouse as a cook, preparing food for the soldiers stationed there.
When I saw Milena being beaten and imprisoned, I tried to sneak her some food.
I felt so sorry for her and agreed to bring you a letter she wrote.
Thank you! You risked a lot by coming here.
We'll figure something out! Please tell her that if you get the chance.
If you're reading this, you probably know that the soldiers caught me. I was trying to steal cargo papers that would allow us to evacuate the collection. Now those doors are closed forever. This sweet girl Maria is helping me, bringing some food to my cell, and she even agreed to take this letter to you. Please, don’t lose hope! You need to secure what's left and find a way to evacuate the items from the museum. Our mission lies solely in your hands now...
No – I hoped to see her with you here.
She still hasn't come back?
Not yet – but she will! She must...
She doesn't have much time. The military is preparing for something big tonight.
Trucks have been going in and out the whole day, loading heavy weapons and explosives.
They're going to bomb us again.
Probably. I heard some soldiers talking and bragging about it.
One of them said they were going to set the sky on fire tonight.
We can't leave now, not without Milena!
It's not safe here. You should consider leaving as soon as possible.
Maria! Did you bring any news about Milena?
Milena escaped her cell in the warehouse.
I helped her... but then guards spotted her and started shooting.
She didn't, not yet – but she's strong. She'll find a way.
She doesn't have much time. The military is preparing for something big tonight.

We can't leave now, not without Milena!
But we'll be prepared for the worst-case scenario. Thank you.
I think she got shot. I was really hoping that she'd managed to get back here.
Why do you care? I thought you just wanted to save your collection.
Those papers are my price. You know where to find me...
What would happen to the people that you're tracking down?
Property Takeovers and Extortion, 1972–1978.
Milena won't even consider your offer.
We told you – our exhibits are not for sale.
It's you again...
It seems you didn't take my offer seriously...
Do you really think you can keep your precious things safe in here?
We do our best.
That won't mean much when the mortars hit your building.
The rumours are that they're regrouping and preparing for another strike.
And you're so concerned about our fate?
I'm concerned about the documents I need!
They could be gone forever if you don't start acting more reasonably.
Are your threats supposed to change my mind?
Remember – I'm your best way out of this mess.
Listen... The offer is still on the table, but your time is running out.
I'll be waiting for the papers in the same place at night.
Hey! Can you please help my brother?
Your brother? What happened to him?
He got trapped behind some rubble after a grenade hit our building.
Papa Adam is trying to reach him, but I know he'll need some help!
Sure kid, where are they?
Upstairs. Come, I'll show you.
Thank you for saving my brother from that rubble!
Oh, it's no big deal Neven. I was happy to help.
I'm Neven by the way.
It's just nice to see someone who cares.
Adam... I thought I was going to die in there!
It's OK Luka, you're safe now.
I promised I'd take care of you, didn't I?
And you won't leave us like our parents?
No, I'm right here with you.
You're the one who helped Papa and saved me!
Ha, I wish I was Luka!
Are you an angel or something?
I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.
You're so modest... I think you really are an angel!
Because a real angel would never admit to being an angel!
I can't thank you enough for helping with clearing this rubble.
We reached Luka in the nick of time! What brings you here?
One of the kids you're taking care of said that you could use some help.
He got sick. Pretty bad too. Now he needs help, and I can't go out while leaving him and the kids alone here.
Maybe I could help you. What do you need?
Maybe you could talk to her, try to cheer her up a bit...
I'm so sad Papa... I miss my mummy.
Dear child, I can see something's bothering you...
She used to read me fantastic tales before I went to sleep.
Now she's gone, and I'm cold and scared all the time.
I know girl... we'll figure something out.
Hello girl. You're Nika, right?
I am. Thank you for helping us!
It's nice to know there's someone kind around.
I know you're not feeling well. Can I do anything for you?
You live in the Museum, right? Do you have any books there?
Well, we might have something...
You know, before this war, my mum used to read to me a lot.
I especially loved the fairy tales with all the drawn pictures!
You don't have any books in here?
I didn't know how to read, so when mum wasn't around, I just looked at the pictures.
Your help means everything to those kids. I'm truly grateful.
I'm glad to hear that. Are you doing any better?
I'm sorry to bother you again, I know you've got a lot on your minds.
It's no problem. What brings you here?
We're struggling every day in our small orphanage, and the kids are losing hope.
Soon, we'll run out of supplies, and I need to figure something out.
There might be some hope though – I've heard rumours...
What kind of rumours?
A man told me about a group of people trying to flee the city.
They're using some old mining tunnels that lead outside the city.
To be honest, that sounds unbelievable...
Do you know where to find those people?
Allegedly, there's a hideout somewhere near the main railway station.
I would check it myself, but it's too far from here.
And you'd like us to check on it?
Don't worry Adam, I'll think about it.
It can be dangerous... I can't risk leaving the kids alone for so long.
I can see you're feeling better, Andreas.
Yes... and it wouldn't be possible without your help.
I'll soon be ready to go out and help Adam with the supplies again.
It seems to me you really care about everyone here.
They're my siblings now, and the only family I have left.
I'm the oldest one too, so I'm helping as much as I can.
Do you think we'll get into trouble for letting that bitch run away?
"My plan for evacuating the collection didn't work out. Even if my friends at the museum can secure the items and prepare them for evacuation, we still won't have any way to get them somewhere safe.</n>I overheard some soldiers talking... We can't trust the Colonel, as all he wants is to make a fortune for himself. Maria is going to help me run away. I'll have to figure out what to do once I get out, but for the first time, I'm starting to feel helpless and that my mission will fail..."
Come on – I shot her! You saw it, right?
We'll look for the body first thing in the morning.
She got shot. I'm sure she won't get far with a gunshot wound.
What are you doing here?!
I'm looking for Milena. I thought I could help her out somehow.
Where are they keeping her?
She's not here anymore... I helped her run away.
I sneaked a saw blade to her cell, but things went downhill from there...
What do you mean? What happened?!
Milena used the sawblade I brought her and escaped from her cell.
Her plan was to reach a fence on the east side of the complex.
But two soldiers spotted her and started shooting.
Did they... kill her?
I don't know... She was hit but managed to run into the darkness.
I hope she's going to make it, but...
No! If you hadn't helped her, she might already be dead.
They wouldn't keep her alive forever. At least now, there's still hope...
Is it my fault? If I hadn't brought her that saw blade...
That Colonel Markov is obsessed with her for some goddamn reason.
But we don't have a body... The Colonel is going to be furious!
Looking for Names
Some fools testified against me in a major property takeover case from the ’70s. Their testimonies overshadowed the last decade of my life and career. I need those case files to erase any traces of the case and track down the people who were behind it. You might not agree with what I'm doing, but I'm your best chance to succeed in your mission.
One of the fools trying to testify against me.
What's going on here? Who is this man?!
Did you bring what I need?
It's your call. When you're ready, you know where to find me.
I'm glad you've made up your mind.
And how is that going to work?
Don't test my patience!
Maybe you don't trust me, or question what I'm doing here.
But I keep my promises. I will help you with your collection.
We will put your collection in an underground vault.
I have access to the Pogoren Bank – meet me in the back alley there.
We can't go there now, not without Milena.
Do you really think she's coming back?
I don't know, but we're going to wait as long as possible.
That whole trial put me in a lot of trouble.
But I'll make sure that once this war is over, all remains of the case will be gone.
What have you done to him?
I just asked him a few questions. But he wasn't all that eager to talk.
I needed the names of his foolish friends in case you didn't show up with the documents.
And if I don't give them to you, will you slaughter me as well?
I'm not a murderer! These men ruined my life with their loose tongues.
So I'm going to track them all down – with or without you!
But... we can help each other. Have you got those files?
Property Takeovers and Extortions
Documentation of a famous Pogoren lawsuit from a few years ago. It contains testimonies of numerous victims of illegal real estate takeovers and property extortions. These illegal activities were commited by an organized crime group called 'the housing mob'.
Documentation of a famous Pogoren lawsuit from several years ago. For some reason Taras desperately wants to lay his hands on them.
A mass testimony against a criminal group. What will happen to those people if the papers fall into the wrong hands? Can we bargain with their fate?
You can find me in my office if you need anything.
The man we just passed is our janitor, Zoran. He helps me out and lives here as well.
Hurry up, Anja! You'll have plenty of time once I've shown you around.
Anja, please, we don't have all day!
Anja, could you come here for a moment?
If the military is looking for this painting, I have to hide it.
Hey, everyone! I've found a truck!
I barely managed to bring it here, and it definitely needs to be repaired.
Ah, damn it! I'd better not touch it in case I break it even more.
How's the truck? We need to fix it if we want to protect our collection.
It's still not working. If we don't repair it soon, the collection will be destroyed.
I should check on the truck.
It's fixed! We'll be able to move our collection somewhere safe soon.
We need to focus on our goal. There's still a lot to do.
The heritage of our community must survive.
It's sad that Ruben didn't make it. I hope Anja will be able to get through this.
We should be able to leave soon. The truck only needs a few more repairs, and we're ready to go.
That Colonel doesn't seem trustworthy.
Why should I take help from the military when I can protect these assets myself?
So, an army man wants to help when it's guys like him who are the reason for our situation...
How do we know the Colonel won't betray us? We'd better ignore his offer.
I worry about any mortar attacks in the future. We need to make sure our truck is fixed before then.
Taking all the exhibits to the truck might take a while...
Now we need to find a safe place to go to, but at least we've got our truck fixed.
We have to figure out our next move, but I definitely feel more confident now the truck's fixed.
I feel more confident knowing the truck is working again.
We have to make sure we're ready to evacuate.
I have to make sure our work is well documented.
I'm so tired... I haven't had much sleep lately.
We have to focus on our mission – it's bigger than all of us.
If we don't finish what we do, our entire legacy is in jeopardy.
I hope some traders show up so we can get more supplies.
Anyone here? I've heard you can help me hide something.
Anyone here? I've heard you can help me hide something.
He... He went to the warmth – and it accepted him.
He's not breathing, is he. He doesn't need to anymore.
He became one with the light. I want to be there too...
You came to see the Colonel, right? He told us you might show up. Come on, get in.
This is a military outpost, so you'd better have a damned good reason for being here!
The truck won't start! Come on, we've got to go!
If we don't leave now, we'll be buried with our collection.
Shit. They didn't fix the truck on time...
If I don't leave now, I'll be buried with the collection.
We have to get on the truck and evacuate. Now!
I have to get on the truck and evacuate immediately!
My God... Everything's on fire! I must get to the truck!
Shit! Someone's destroyed one of the exhibits!
Go ahead, Anja, I'm not feeling well. I'll just wait here.
The most important memento of my Grandpa, gone...
Why would anyone do this to me?
My wooden aurochs! Why would you do this?!
My aurochs should be safe here. I'm glad it didn't get destroyed during the bombing.
What's wrong with you! We're supposed to save these things, not break them!
What are they doing! Breaking items...
What the... If you have to destroy something, choose the common things!
Congratulations, you're turning our collection into a rubbish dump.
Damn... That was one of my favourite items here.
I just hope it'll help us get through this. We won't be able to save everything.
I'm so glad to see those things being put safe and secure.
We're saving many valuable exhibits.
At this point, you're just a vandal. We still have plenty of fuel to burn!
Please, stop it! We have enough fuel, there's no need to do this!
Please, don't do this! That's our legacy!
Why are you doing this? Don't you understand how important these are?!
There has to be another way! Please... Stop!
Please! Stop! We've gone through so much already without sacrificing these things as well...
Just hang in there a little longer! I'm sure we'll manage without that fuel somehow.
To be honest, I don't feel guilty anymore. At least we'll be able to survive.
Maybe I'm overthinking this... After all, these are only things.
It makes me sad that we're forced to do this – but if we don't, we might freeze to death!
I wish we didn't have to do this...
We're freezing here. I wish there was another way...
I hope you realise what you're doing.
I know we don't have much fuel, but that doesn't justify destroying our heritage.
Maybe I'm overthinking this... After all, these are only things.
I won't judge you, but I also can't watch what you're doing any longer.
I can't watch what you're doing to our heritage.
I need to process what I've seen here.
We were supposed to be safer here...
We got hit pretty bad last night.
Come here, kids! We should start getting warmer in a moment.
Luka, my boy!
Andreas... I'm so sorry you ended up like this.
I swear I'll get something to warm you up. You'll get better soon.
Thank you so much for your help!
Thank God! The poor kid's got stuck behind that pile of rubble. We need to dig through, quickly!
Adam!
Adam! Someone came to help us!
Oh, please help us!
Hey, guys! Come quickly! We just got some amazing books!
You did it! Luka is saved!
Hey, Andreas! Luka is safe now, you don't have to worry...
Hurry up! He's trapped in here!
We need to get him out!
Please, save him!
He might get crushed if we don't free him quickly!
I've had enough with this boy...
Think about my offer!
Hey! What the fuck are you doing here?
Fuck... The Colonel will be pissed.
Oh! It's you from the museum. Keep the door closed!
Meds for a Stranger
Milena brought us some meds and offered a place in her museum, but a trip like that can be risky at the moment. We could move there once my companion gets better, and with Milena's gift, that task should be easier.
Meds for a Stranger
Milena brought some necessary meds for a man I was taking care of. Unfortunately, she was too late. She's asked me to join her in the museum, but it's not easy to leave my family house behind. Although, right now, there's nothing more keeping me here.
We can't leave without Milena.
We should wait for Milena before we go.
Milena might still show up – we should wait.
Warehouse
Milena got caught by soldiers and is being held in this Military Warehouse. We could try to reach her, but this place is heavily guarded by armed men and going there could be extremely dangerous...
I have to be careful... hold on Milena.

Footprints of Milena's shoes
Milena's note
Milena had to run away, this way...
Here's what we have to do...
I had to sacrifice one of the documents we had...
But I made a deal with a man named Taras. He will hide our things in a secret vault.
Taras... I know the man. He’s done some terrible things in the past...
I wish there was another way, but we have to trust him.
You’re right. Colonel Markov is looking for us at this very moment.
He's obsessed with the painting, and he’s got troops all over the city...
We’ll hide the collection, but first we need to get you some help!
No Anja... It’s too late for me. But not for you!
I had to sacrifice our painting... I gave it to the Colonel.
But we made a deal. He promised to let us through the Mountain Pass!
Oh girl... I told you not to trust him! I don't think he'll let us through.
I’m sorry Milena but you were gone... I didn’t know what to do.
When I was imprisoned, I overheard soldiers talking...
All he wants is to get his hands on the collection, far from his superiors’ eyes.
So are we going to the Mountain Pass?
It’s not your fault, Anja! You did whatever you could.
I wish there was another way, but we have to play with the cards we have.
Here's what we have to do...
We can’t go together. It’s too big of a risk...
We have to split up if we want to deceive the Colonel's men.
We can't leave now. We have nowhere to go.
We have to find a way to secure items before we go.
We don't know how to evacuate with our collection.
But also, about those who we're saving it for...
You never forgot about them, and I hope you never will...
About our people. And the generations yet to come.
Rescue Milena.
Move the collection to the Main Storage.
Gather items scattered across Pogoren.
Get the truck ready for evacuation.
Find a way to secure the Museum Collection.
Escape from the Museum.
Help children at the Orphanage.
Anja decided to join the Museum and risked a lot to bring her family collection. With Anja's help it should be easier to deal with the consequences of recent bombings in the area. There's still a lot of work to do to secure our collection</n></n>
Taras the trader came back to us with an offer. He can help us hide the collection in an underground bank vault. In exchange he asked for some old case files that would lead him to witnesses he's looking for. Who knows what he's going to do with those people if we hand him the documents... He'll be waiting for us at the abandoned construction site if we decide to make a deal with him.
Our truck is fixed, and we can prepare for evacuation, but we're still waiting for Milena. We can't go without her when there's even a remote chance of her being alive. We should wait for her as long as we can.
We found Milena's notebook in the warehouse where she was imprisoned. It seems that she was slowly losing hope there – her final plan for securing the collection had collapsed:</n></n>"My plan for evacuating the collection didn't work out. Even if my friends at the museum manage to secure the items and prepare them for evacuation, we still won't have any way to get them somewhere safe. </n>I overheard some soldiers talking... We can't trust the Colonel because all he wants is to make a fortune for himself. Maria is going to help me run away. I'll have to figure out what to do once I get out, but for the first time I'm starting to feel helpless about my mission..."
A woman named Maria visited our Museum today and she brought us essential informations about Milena's whereabouts. Milena got kidnapped by soldiers when she was trying to steal self-conduct papers from a Military Warehouse. We don't know how long are they going to keep her there. We need to take action before they transport her to prison or do something worse...
Milena tried to escape from a warehouse where she was being held. She was shot by one of the guards and disappeared into darkness. We don't know where she is right now. We don't know if she's even alive...
The army is planning another bombing raid in our area. We did whatever we could to find and gather the items spread across the city, but now we need to protect what we have and prepare for the worst.
Anja's golden necklace had to be given away, but we finally got the parts we needed to repair our truck. Once we fix it and the tanks are filled with petrol, transport should be ready for evacuation.
The army is planning another bombing raid in our area. We did whatever we could to find and gather the items spread across the city, but now we need to protect what we have and prepare for the worst.
We were able to fool the guy at the workshop, and we finally got the parts we needed to repair our truck. Once we fix it and the tanks are filled with petrol, transport should be ready for evacuation.
The ceiling in the office area collapsed last night. At that point, there wasn't much more we could do to stop it. The good news is that the structure below seems rigid for now.
The ceiling in the exhibition area collapsed last night. At that point, there wasn't much more we could do to stop it. The good news is that the structure below seems rigid for now
Another floor collapsed last night, and the main structure is continuing to fall apart. We need to hurry with securing the spaces underneath.
The documents were handed over to Taras. In exchange he promised to help us secure our collection somewhere safe. We still have to wait for Milena to come back if we want to move from here, but at least we have somewhere to go
That's you! Good that you've made up your mind.
Where did I put it...?
I need that lamp to keep working.
I have to get rid of him before he starts to stink...
With no clients, this place is quite boring...
Once this war is over, I think I'll hang some new curtains here.
Tonight it's quite calm so far...
Get your dirty hands off Bertie!
Please, help us... We're freezing here.
Please, leave me alone...
It doesn't matter Anja...
Milena... You're bleeding out. We should get you some help!
I failed. Look at that... We have nowhere to go.
Actually... I might've found a way to save our collection.
What do you mean?
We need to hurry up and secure items from endangered areas.
Another bombing last night. Will this ever stop?
I wonder if we can survive another bombing.
I'll help Anja here. I owe this to her.
We got hurt, but I'm sure Milena will figure something out.
I wonder what happens if we get hit again.
Securing our exhibits is now more important than ever.
So many things have happened to me recently...
I'm so grateful to Anja for her help.
At least we have a roof over our heads.
Anja! You're safe!
Milena?!
Build another heater.
We have to build a second heater to heat the Museum more efficiently. The temperature inside is dropping rapidly, so we should keep the temperature above 10 degrees to make sure this piercing cold won't hurt us.
But I'll have to take that risk.
We've been being deluded and deceived numerous times...
By men that should never be trusted.
But maybe there are things and values we should not compromise...
Even if that means we won't be able to save everything.
And make sure they will never find you.
They will be looking for you. </n>So take with you whatever you can.
We have to split up if we want to deceive the Colonel's men.
Because one day, this war is going to be over.
So you have to survive and help others to survive as well.
Help those who can pass down our story through the generations.
And cultivate the heritage we were fighting for.
They want to take over everything we fought for.
We have to split up if we want to deceive the Colonel's men.
So take what you can with you.
Eventually, Anja gave it to little Nika. 'My mother gave it to me, and she got it from her mother,' she told the girl, hugging her closely.
Crow, the car mechanic, wanted Anja to give him gold for car parts, but she found another way to acquire them. The necklace remained in her possession.
The necklace disappeared when Crow was killed, and his garage plundered and burned. The only thing from the garage that survived the war was Crow's beloved car Bertie.
Anja gave up an item from her private collection – a precious token of her memories – to save the Museum's artworks.
When the fighting in Pogoren came to an end and staff at the Museum started to catalogue and secure the artworks, it turned out that some of them were missing. Taras was the obvious suspect, but nothing could be proved.
Unable to trust either Colonel Markov or Taras the fence, Anja faced a difficult choice. Thanks to her decision, the collection was safely stored in a bank vault – to which Taras the fence still had access...
After the war, items from the Museum started to pop up on art markets and in private collections all over the world. Thanks to the persistent efforts of the Museum staff and witness testimonies, most of them were returned to Pogoren.
Unable to trust either Colonel Markov or Taras the fence, Anja faced a difficult choice. Her decision led to the Colonel's taking over most of the collection. He used the cultural cleansing as an opportunity to get rich, smuggling the artworks abroad and auctioning them piecemeal.
Little Nika, who found solace in the fairy tales after the death of her mother, took the books with her after the war. Years later, she read the fascinating stories about the brothers of Old Graznavia to her own children.
After the war, the books were transferred to the city library, rebuilding the collection lost during the 'cultural cleansing'. Due to their incredible history they became part of a special collection, exhibited in a bulletproof glass case.
Little Nika, who found solace in the fairy tales after the death of her mother, took the books with her after the war. Years later, she read the fascinating stories about the brothers of Old Graznavia to her own children.
The documents were never found, Taras probably destroyed them. After the war, many criminal and civil property takeover cases were discontinued due to missing documentation and the disappearance of material witnesses.
It was later transferred to the new Samuel Institute as a silent reminder of the tragedy which took place there.
It was located and brought back to Pogoren shortly after the war thanks to the efforts of the Samuel Institute, but it wasn't returned to the Museum. It is now held at the new Institute as a silent reminder of the tragedy which took place there.
The efforts of the Samuel Institute to locate the manuscript and bring it back to Pogoren started immediately after the war, but they have yet to bear fruit. Nevertheless, the staff has no intention to abandon the search.
After the war, the painting returned to the rebuilt Pogoren Museum. As the centrepiece of the collection, it became a material reminder of the dramatic history of the city and its inhabitants.
Two years after the war, thanks to an anonymous tip-off, the painting was rediscovered aboard a freighter bound for one of the Middle-Eastern states. It was returned to the rebuilt Pogoren Museum.

Let's move the documents from Milena's office before leaving!
Zoran had a hard time coming to terms with Milena's death, but finally he accepted it as a sacrifice. He spent the rest of the war clearing the Museum ruins and later helped rebuild it.
Are you sure you want to pack and leave now?
I'm so glad my items are still safe...
The children's books entrusted to the care of the Museum went where they were needed most: to the orphanage. They helped the kids to cope with their worst memories.
The children's books entrusted to the care of the Museum weren't lost when Colonel Markov intercepted the collection at the mountain pass. Anja decided to keep them for the kids in the orphanage.
The children's books entrusted to the care of the Museum were safely stored in a bank vault with the rest of the collection.
The manuscript disappeared after Anja agreed to part with it in exchange for passage through the tunnels. It was a difficult decision, but it bought the safety and well-being of Adam's charges.
The manuscript fell into the hands of Colonel Markov along with the rest of the collection.
Thanks to the choices Anja made, the manuscript was kept safe in a bank vault until the war ended.
Determined to evacuate the collection from the war zone, Anja took Colonel Markov up on his offer and handed over the painting to him. Alas, he never intended to keep his end of the deal and took over the whole collection.
Determined to secure a way out of the war zone, Anja took Colonel Markov up on his offer and handed over the painting to him. When she changed her mind, it was too late: the Colonel disappeared along with the painting.
To save the collection, Anja had to make many hard choices, but she didn't let the pearl of the Museum's collection fall into Colonel Markov’s hands. The painting was hidden in a vault until the end of the siege.
The case file was lost in the turmoil of war, but most of the witnesses named within survived. After the war ended, they testified in many civil and criminal property takeover cases, which ended in convictions for numerous members of the 'housing mob' – including Taras.
Despite the desperate circumstances and her determination to save the collection, Anja decided not to give the documents to Taras the fence, not knowing the fate that he had planned for the people he sought.
Having no good choices and determined to save the collection, Anja decided to give the documents to Taras the fence, not knowing the fate that he had planned for the people he sought.
Not all the treasures of the Museum could be saved. Some were sacrificed. Some vanished forever.
Such an important part of our culture turned to ashes...
War caused irreparable damage to the cultural heritage of Pogoren. But without the sacrifices made by Anja, Milena and others, many more priceless treasures would have been lost.
What have I done...?
The Museum collection was secured in a bank vault.
Most of the artworks made it through to the end of the war.
The Museum collection has been taken by Colonel Markov.
Some artworks were lost forever.
The Museum of Pogoren has been destroyed.
You have failed to save the collection.
Milena might still show up – we should wait.
Tito made it.

The end of the Museum
Incalculable loss
Several people died and dozens were wounded when snipers and mortars took aim at the attendees of an open air concert. This horrific attack on our cultural identity finally drew condemnation from the international community; too little, too late.
After a night of heroic efforts, volunteer firefighters withdrew from the fire at the city archives, which is now raging out of control. Thankfully, the most valuable documents and most important records were evacuated before the bombardment.
Milena's capture
The famous Grand Mosque has been hit by several large-calibre shells. There's no doubt that the destruction of the religious centres of Pogoren is deliberate, part of a campaign aimed at erasing the unique culture of our city.
The Basilica of Stephan the Martyr is on fire after a continuous mortar barrage shattered the damaged dome and ignited the scaffolding. Volunteer firefighters are battling the blaze, defying machine guns and snipers targeting them.
The books are safe...
Milena's escape

I made a choice.
It's your call. I just thought you should know.
There are rumours that the army is regrouping and preparing for another strike.

I stole the parts.
I just came to say that everything is set for you.

We should wait for Milena.
My neighbour Tito survived. I brought him some fuel so he could keep the deathly cold away during the long nights.
My neighbour Tito didn't made it through the winter. He froze to death alone in his house.
Tito was now warmer, but he was ill and suffering from frostbite. I brought him some food to help him recover.
I failed to save Ruben. He died in his sleep. I hope he's in a better place now.
The stranger I sheltered came to. He said his name was Ruben. He told me about the pogrom.
Anyone here? I've heard you can help me hide something.
During the move to the Museum, Ruben died in the street. I only wanted us to be safe – and I killed him.
We moved to the Museum to be safe. It seemed like it was one of the worst days of my life...
We secured the most priceless artworks before the collapse. I couldn't help thinking about all we had to sacrifice.
After my collection was damaged in the fire, Milena the curator insisted that I move with it to the Museum.
We failed to rescue some of the priceless artworks before the collapse. I thought I'd never live this down.
That night, our nightmares came true. The Museum burned to the ground. We couldn't save everything.
Friendship of Nations', a beloved mosaic by Miha Koren which until yesterday graced the city park, is the latest victim of the war on culture, smashed into millions of shards by machine gun fire.
Fire gutted the Philharmonic, destroying its unique Secession ornaments and XVIII century organ. 'They knew what they were doing', a witness reported. 'First they blew the roof off with explosive shells, then they switched to incendiaries.'
The Grand Mosque is no more, erased from the face of the earth by an avalanche of high explosive shells. How much longer will the world watch idly, as the modern barbarians destroy the treasures of our culture?!
Maria, a cook from the Military Warehouse, told us that Milena was being held there.
The walls of the Basilica, weakened by the fire, collapsed last night. The oldest church in Pogoren is now a pile of rubble.
Milena got caught by soldiers and was imprisoned there. We tried to reach her in a heavily guarded place, but when we got there she was already gone. She tried her own escape plan, and this is where her trail ends...
The owner of the children's books collection came to take them back. She left empty-handed and very angry.
While trying to spring Milena out of Military Warehouse, we discovered that she had already managed to escape.
That scoundrel Markov demanded the most precious Vysenian painting for a chance of saving our collection.
I decided to take Markov up on his offer. It seemed to be the lesser evil.
Thank you for the information, but we owe this to her.
It's naive to believe that she's still alive. And you don't have much time.
We acquired the truck, fixed it and started to prepare the collection for evacuation. We just needed a safe place to go to...
When you're ready, we can move your things to a safe place.
My necklace was the price I had to pay for the truck parts. I gave up another part of my childhood... for the future.
I swiped the parts for the truck from a creep gloating about preying on people's misery. I regretted nothing.
It's you again...
Request Fulfilled
Objectives Achieved
Adam, who single-handedly runs a house for war orphans, desperately needed fuel to keep his charges warm.
I brought Adam some fuel so he could keep his orphans warm. They had no one else to turn to.
I decided to give the collection of fables to Adam's kids. I felt good about it all day.
I can't go through this again....
The people who control the tunnel out of the city demanded a valuable manuscript for smuggling the kids to safety.
I gave up the Sefer-ha Zohar manuscript in exchange for the kids' safe passage out of the war zone.
I secured the safety of our collection. I paid for it with lives of innocent people.
Another body and more things destroyed. Why did this happen to us...?
I bade farewell to Milena and the Museum collection. Will I ever see them again? I must have hope...
The collection is safe from Markov. I hope Milena made it – or at least died laughing in his face...
This house has always been my home and a shelter for several generations of my family. Hopefully it can withstand the war...
In these difficult times, the Museum has become our home. But for years it's been a home to many treasures of our culture.
We've managed to build another heater in our shelter. It should be easier to keep the temperature high enough, but we mustn't forget to keep feeding them with enough fuel.
In this extremely cold winter, our struggle for survival seems harder then ever. We need to constantly check the temperature and keep the heater working to make sure we don't freeze to death over night. If we manage to keep the temperature above 10 degrees, we should be all right...</n>
Names Hunt
I can help you out with the collection, but I need something first – they're worthless to you, just some old lawsuit case files. A few people said some unpleasant things about me in the past, and now might be my best chance to... change their minds. Meet me at the abandoned construction site, far from anyone's eyes, so we can make a deal.
Are you sure you want to destroy a unique item? Once it's turned to ashes there's no going back...
Trader Taras will be waiting for us there if we decide to make a deal with him. He's expecting us to bring some incriminating documents that he wants to get rid of. In exchange, he promised to help us with the evacuation.
It's time to leave...
Waiting any longer is too dangerous.
Oh God... Poor Tito.
Poor Tito... What a terrible way to die...
I can't do this now, I need some rest.
I can't carry it right now...
Why are we even doing this...?
I'm not feeling well. I should rest.
I need to recover before I get back to work.
Our work here is useless.
Who are we securing this for...?
I need to recover before I can carry anything.
It's heavy and I'm recovering. Can't do it right now.
Welcome to my... umm... store!
Eh... Whatever...
Finally! I sold something here!
Oh, man! I'm on a roll!
H–hello, friend! Welcome to my umm... store!
We have umm... low prices... very low prices!
And... and the quality? Best quality in town!
Pure genius, man...
Who would have thought of stealing from the supermarket during a war?
Oh wait... apparently everyone from the neighbourhood!
All that's left for us is some rubbish lying around....
Heh, right...
Can't wait to see that...
Hey you! Don't try anything stupid!
If you came to trade, make it quick!
Updated
Looks like we have a customer! It's your time to shine...
Yeah, yeah... shut up already...
It's not that bad, OK? I'm telling you – we're going to get rich!
I was born to be a salesman! You'll see!
I just let my natural charm do all the work.
No problem friend... Just hope you'll change your mind!
All of our... umm... inventory is... worth buying.
The b–best stuff for... ugh... the best price.
Did I... umm... did I mention low prices?
We have to build a second heater to heat the Museum more efficiently. The temperature inside is dropping rapidly, so we should keep the temperature above 50 degrees to make sure this piercing cold won't hurt us.
In this extremely cold winter our struggle for survival seems harder then ever. We need to constantly check the temperature and keep the heater working to make sure we don't freeze to death over night. If we manage to keep the temperature above 50 degrees, we should be all right...</n>
Don't worry, Zoran.
You see, Zoran? The truck is ready!
Did you see that woman who brought us her books?
It seems that we secured all the remaining items.
Skip Prologue
Ruben is freezing.
The temperature in the shelter is extremely low. We need to generate more heat if we want to save Ruben.
The museum's been hit again... We need to hurry up with our work.
Together, we should be able to secure all the items in time.
Thank you for your help...
I wish I could do more, but I'm not as strong as I used to be...
You've dedicated so much to this museum!
It will pay off one day. You'll see.
We'll be able to save the collection soon.
There's still a lot to do... but you're right.
We should be happy today. It might be just one step...
But it's a step in a right direction.
It reminded me again of how important our mission is.
People seem to trust you and Milena with their belongings.
Oh, yes. When the war started, many people brought their valuable items here.
They knew that if there was one person able to keep their things safe, it had to be Milena.
Oh, yes! Thank God... And thank you!
Without your help, I'd never have made it in time.
No need to thank me, Zoran. We're all in this together.
A woman named Maria brought us some news about Milena. She got caught by soldiers and she's being held in the Military Warehouse for now. God only knows what they're going to do to her. We have to do something about it...
Poor Milena... Did everything she could to secure the collection. Sacrificed so much already, and now she might pay the highest price. We really should help her out.
I'm devastated after hearing about Milena... She has to know she's not alone! If I could, I would go and rescue her by myself right now! But I'm so weak... Thank God there's more of us! There's still some hope for her.</n>
Learning about what happened at the Military Warehouse is quite devastating. I'm deeply worried about Milena, but what's worse is that without her we need to figure out a way to secure our collection by ourselves...
We were too late to rescue Milena from the warehouse. As always, instead of waiting for others, she decided to take her fate in her own hands. I just really hope it wasn't her last heroic move and she's still there somewhere. I hope she'll come back! In the meantime we need to decide on our next moves.
I feel like my worst nightmares are being unveiled in front of my eyes... Milena hiding somewhere, probably shot and wounded... At this point she might be even dead, and I can't do anything about it.
Maria came to the museum again! I hoped maybe she would have new information about Milena, but instead she brought some disturbing news... The army is planning something big for tonight. I don't think we can wait for Milena anymore – we have to prepare and leave as soon as possible.
After learning about new actions taken by the army, we should prepare for evacuation immediately. We've waited for Milena long enough – now it's our last chance to act.
I wish we could wait for Milena longer. I wish she was there, safe and sound... But it is what it is... We must leave soon if we don't want to get buried here with our collection...
We had another visitor today – a trader named Taras. He was selling some regular stuff but he was also suspiciously interested in some documents we have.
A trader named Taras paid us a visit today. I feel we should be careful with people wandering around... There's loads of shady guys trying to take advantage of the current circumstances. And that guy definitely asked too many questions.
Another guy sniffing around our stuff today! I hope Milena comes back soon to scare away shady guys like that Taras. She really knows how to deal with scoundrels like that one!
Taras paid us a visit again. This time with an offer. He wants to lay his hands on a document we have, and in return he promised to help us hide our collection. He's not a person I would like to deal with, but we don't have many other options at this point....
That trader called Taras came with an offer this time. Maybe he really can help us, but life has taught me not to trust people like him. There's something about him that makes me really question his intentions.
That Taras guy is a real thug... I'm sure he's done awful things before the war, and now he's using tragic circumstances to his advantage. I really hope we won't ever see him again!
Taras received what he wanted... I'm trying not to think about the consequences of his laying his hands on those files. But some decisions had to be made, and at least there might be a chance to save the rest of the collection...
We handed the documents to Taras. I want to think it was a price worth paying, but I guess we'll have to wait and see if he keeps his promise and helps us with the collection.
We've given away another item... I understand that might be our only chance to save all the rest. But is it really for us to make decisions like this?</n>
The stranger is freezing.
The temperature in the shelter is extremely low. We need to generate more heat if we want to save the man.
Hello! Can we talk?
There's something you should know!
Please, we need to talk!
Hey! Please, I need to talk with you!
I just want to talk. Please, open!
Hey! We need to talk!

Evacuating Museum
Mountain Pass
Old Bank Vault
We need to evacuate now! Because of our deal with the Colonel, we should be able to use a road heading out of town. The route leads through a Mountain Pass south of Pogoren. The Colonel's troops that are stationed there should let us through... We don't know if we can trust them, but it's our last resort.
We need to evacuate now! Thanks to our deal with Taras, we should be able to hide the collection in an underground vault. We're supposed to meet with Taras in a back alley of an abandoned bank, but can we really trust a man like him? Time will tell, but for now it's our last resort...
I shouldn't have gone there...
Looking at their dead bodies was so painful...
Poor people...
I hope you will meet them on the otherside, Ruben.
I hope Ruben won't decide to go there...
I gave away my necklace...
How much more do we have to sacrifice?
I had to give away Anja's necklace...
But it had to be done if we want to escape this place.
Another sacrifice we had to make...
But there's no price we can put on those children's lives...
I'm not convinced he won't betray us...
But making a deal with Taras might be our best chance.
Good thing Milena doesn't know about this.
I just hope sacrificing that painting can save the rest of our collection.
I should check the Railway Station to help those poor souls from the orphanage...
Seeing those kids reading is heart-warming...
But there's one more thing I should discuss with Adam later.
Books, huh? It reminds me of all the fairy tales I loved to read as a child...
It's good to know these children will be warm, at least for a while.
Andras seems like a good kid.
I hope he'll get better soon...
It's terrifying how fragile human life is...
But knowing we might have just saved one of them is quite uplifting...
Horrible times... Everyone is constantly hungry and cold.
I'm glad we were able to help Tito.
It might be difficult to gather enough fuel for Tito...
But I can't imagine just leaving him to die...
I feel terrible for Tito, but I have to keep in mind my own survival...
We must gather everything worth saving.
I hope our efforts won't go unnoticed.

Important Notes
A dead body... I knew this man...
I shouldn't have come back here... Memories are haunting me.
Those bastards didn't only come to kill those people... They wanted to erase everything.
We have to run away!
I couldn't do anything more...
I've failed...
We couldn't do anything more...
I'm so sorry... We've failed.
Oh no! Where are my things?!
First my people are brutally murdered and now this?!
Is nothing sacred to anyone anymore?
Anja! How could you?
I understand we have to make sacrifices... but this?
Anja left the besieged city, following Adam and the kids through the tunnels. After the war they returned to Pogoren together and opened a home for war orphans.
Anja joined Adam at his house, helping him care for the kids. After the war they remained in Pogoren, running a home for war orphans.
Ruben made it to the end of war, trying to find other survivors of the massacre. After the war he was involved in the search for Sefer ha-Zohar. He never forgave Anja for her decision to give up the manuscript, but he wrote to her once saying that he understood her motives.
After leaving the Museum, Ruben parted with Anja and made it to the end of war, trying to find other survivors of the massacre. After the war he got in touch with her and was involved in the rebuilding of the Samuel Institute.
Zoran couldn't come to terms with the loss of the collection and Milena's death. He lived to see the end of war, but shortly thereafter he committed suicide in the ruins of the Museum.
Thank you for helping us. When I grow up, I want to be as brave as you!
Zoran did not survive the siege of Pogoren. He would be missed by everyone who had known him.
Ruben lost his will to live and committed suicide.
Driven to madness by the circumstances, Zoran took his own life.
Ruben couldn’t take it anymore, and he left the shelter. He was never heard of again.
Anja couldn't take this anymore and she decided to take her own life
Anja didn't manage to survive. Another hapless victim of this horrible civil war.
Unable to cope with the tragic circumstances, Anja left the shelter. She was never to be heard of again.
Zoran couldn't cope with the events in the Museum, and he decided to leave the shelter.
Ruben didn't survive. His life – saved earlier by Anja – was taken in the end.
After the destruction of the Museum, Ruben separated from the group. He made it to the end of the war, trying to find other survivors of the massacre he had witnessed.
Zoran couldn't come to terms with what happened to the Museum and Milena. He lived to see the end of war, but shortly thereafter he committed suicide in the ruins of the Museum.
When the Museum got destroyed, Anja went to her family house. She survived until the end of the war, but when it finished, she decided to leave Pogoren and never return.
One painting, and you can save all the rest.
Hello! I heard from one of your kids that you could use some help.
I abandoned my house
I moved to the Museum to be safe. It was hard to leave my home behind but it felt like my best chance at the time...
I need to tell you something!
Good! I’ll come to pick you up in a few days. Until then, be safe, my friend!
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.
Then get your shit together! I’ll drop by in a few days.
Hey there! I need to tell you something!
Hey! I know you're there, I have some information for you!
Please, hear me out!
I just need to tell you something. Open the door!
Hey, let's talk.

Good to see you. Can we talk?
Suit yourself, sucker. Enjoy what’s left of your life.

I remember meeting Petr for the first time like it was yesterday. Our eyes met and I knew immediately that something has changed. War took him away from me, but his child growing under my heart and this memory give me strength to survive.
I remember meeting Petr for the first time like it was yesterday. Our eyes met and I knew immediately that something has changed. But war took him away from me... I'm trying to hold on, but knowing I'll never see him again, I often despair. Only his child growing under my heart keeps me from giving up.
When the war started, we moved into the basement of our apartment house. Petr dealt with getting supplies, I tried to keep house. One night, a very heavy bombardment started when he was out. I never saw him again.
When the war started, we moved into the basement of our apartment house. Petr dealt with getting supplies, I tried to keep house. One night, when he was out, dozens of mortar shells started raining upon the city. One of the blasts I've heard that night must've been the last thing my Petr heard...
This child... it's a blessing. When I learned I'm pregnant, I was beside myself with joy. It's harder to survive this damned war, sure... But this child is all I have left of Petr. It's my reason to live.
This child... I'm thinking about it all the time. It's all I have left of my Petr, the only reason for me to struggle. But... it makes it all so much harder... I don't know if I can survive this war.
I just felt something wonderful. Our child... it moved! This war needs to end soon. I don't want to give birth in these circumstances. I wonder if it's a girl or a boy...
Sometimes I think if it wouldn't be better if we'd never met. He would be somewhere out there, still alive... and my life couldn't be any more miserable. But our child.... maybe it's worth the struggle.
Pharmacy
One of several pharmacies that survived the bombardments intact. It was probably looted long time ago, but maybe we still might find some meds there.
Let's see if there's anything left here...
Ruined Toy Store
This toy store used to bring joy to the children of Pogoren. Now it's a silent reminder of the happiness taken away from them by war.
This place looks so sad...
Park
The park is considered a relatively safe area. There are no buildings to attract mortar barrages, and cover of trees discourages snipers.
It seems so peaceful here.
Bakery
This bakery provided fresh bread for many people in pre-war times. Maybe there's still some food left?
I heard that some people moved in here.
Shelled Brewery
One of the oldest buildings in the city. It housed a prosperous brewery, which started gaining international recognition shortly before the war.
It still looks monumental despite the damage from shelling.
The Samuel Institute
The Institute was helping the community until the massacre. As terrible as it sounds, we might find some useful things here.
It looks someone is here.
Railway Station
When the war broke out, people trying to flee the city by train flocked to this station. It was shelled shortly afterwards.
The last train left a long time ago. The one that was supposed to follow was bombed at the station.
Music Club
The ruin of the most luxurious hotel in Pogoren still houses the best music club, located in the basement. Not much of its pre-war splendor survived, but people come here to meet kindred spirits and forget the war for a while.
It's extraordinary they operate during the wartime.
Destroyed Music Club
The ruin of the most luxurious hotel in Pogoren housed the best music club until its owners were killed in a sudden army raid.
This place sends shivers down my spine.
Some parts of radiostation are still here.
Observers warn that we must be prepared for increased shelling tonight. Do not venture outside and stay in the basement if possible.
They say these cans are quite nutritious.
The Pogoren Museum lies in ruins after the recent bombardment. The fate of its priceless collections of antiquities and their custodians is unknown.
Please tell me you have any bandages... I don't think he'll survive any longer.
I need to find something good for my nephew...
Anything that should be played with outside is unfortunately out of question.
I can't imagine what it feels like to be growing up during war.
This constant fear... I'd really want him to have a normal childhood.
But it's so fucking hard...
Ah! It's her!
He's gone? Great! Thank you so much!
Geez... You scared me.
We have to get home quickly, but my sister saw a scary man in the woods!
Fucking cunt...
I'll get them some other time...
Shh, be quiet. He might be armed, so we have to take him out quickly.
Alright! I've unlocked the doors.
Fuck... He was supposed to be alone!
Let's get out of here!
Boss sends his regards, motherfucker!
Okay. I'll just take some food for later.
Oh, and who might that be?
I'm sorry, but my sight is pretty bad since the accident. Are you here to buy some food, dear?
Are you here to buy some food, dear?
Hey mom, it seems we have a visitor.
I don't want to think what would happen if you weren't around...
I've heard some men breaking in here!
Fuck... Okay, I'll take care of them.
Are you still suffering from the eye pain, mom?
Fucking thief...
Looks like our little mouse doesn't have an escape route...
What should we do with her?
Fucking bitch. Stealing from us wasn't your smartest decision!
It's rough times. I think we have to make sure, you won't do that again...
This place looks great! Don't you think?
Hello. We're just trying to survive... please don't make it any harder for us.
You can stay, just keep away from our basement, alright?
I'm glad I could help that wounded guy in pharmacy.
I hope those bandages were enough to save his life.
Sharing the little that we have... It was the only decent thing to do.
Bandages I gave to this wounded guy... I hope they will help.
Bandages are hard to come by... perhaps I should've kept them.
Maybe I shouldn't have given away those bandages after all.
I too would have helped thas wounded man at the pharmacy.
Despite our situation, we can still help others.
It's so hard... can we really afford to help others at our expense?
Let's hope we won't need those bandages we gave away.
Bandages are so precious now... was it wise to give them away?
Why did we give away those bandages... I really wish we hadn't.
^CharacterName^ is so kind, he saved a stranger in need by sharing our bandages with him!
We helped someone in need! We're like superheroes!
I pity those people from the pharmacy... But our survival comes first.
What was I supposed to do? Return empty handed?
They're trying to make it through, just like us, and I robbed them.
I shouldn't have stolen from those poeple at the pharmacy.
Stealing from helpless people... I'm not better than the soldiers.
It'll have been my fault if they don't make it through.
^CharacterName^ stole those things for us. We should be thankful.
Those people from the pharmacy... they wouldn't make it through anyway.
I'm happy I was there to help those children.
We must protect children most of all.
I just wanted to help those children... I got carried away.
Killing this man in park... why he just didnt go away?
That death in park... was it really necessary?
I should've handled that guy in park differently.
Death everywhere... I can't stand it anymore!
My sleep is so shallow recently. This killing in park was just evil.
Killing that man in park was very unfortunate.
Many people went crazy... like that guy in the park.
We should have spared that man in park.
Those children in park didn't want to kill anybody...
Killing that man in park... in cold blood... I can't imagine it.
I can't imagine that ^CharacterName^ killed that man in cold blood.
I hope those children are okay.
Those kids must've found another way though the park.
I feel kind of bad for not helping those children in the park.
I hope nothing bad happened to those poor kids in park.
I'm glad I helped that girl in the brewery.
She was lucky I was there to save her.
I couldn't help that girl in the brewery.
The cruelty of men knows no bounds.
That girl in the brewery... Could I have done something to help her?
Why didn't I stand up to those bastards? I'm a coward.
Those people in bakery were lucky that I was there.
I'm happy I warned that family in the bakery.
Fortunately ^CharacterName^ was able to warn that family.
Maybe we can get some food from that family in the bakery.
War took everyone by surprise. At first people were shocked, struggling to adjust to their new, deadly reality. Now they just try to survive the next day, looking for food and supplies and avoiding danger. </n></n>Livia got pregnant just before the war. When her husband Petr went to get food and didn't return, she started desperately searching for him. She then met Marko, former firefighter, and Zlata, musical school student. They decided to band together to survive.
You could visit the Samuel Institute. There are good folks working there.
Please… if you don't find anything…
I know it wasn't easy to gather fuel and bring it here.
The fuel you brought me should last for a few days, but I need some food to recover.
This construction site is a sad reminder of the Pogoren development program that this war interrupted. The abandoned structure might still hold resources necessary for our survival.
A man collapsed on Anja's doorstep, dying from gunshot wounds and the cold. He is unconscious at the moment, but from time to time Anja can hear single words escaping his mouth. Whatever he dreams of must be truly horrifying…
One painting, and you can save all the rest.
Hello! I heard from one of your kids that you could use some help.
Ah, you must be one of the people Andras told me about!
He used to help me a lot. Going out scavenging, gathering supplies, and–
Colonel Markov is waiting for us at this outpost. He promised to let us through a mountain passage in exchange for a famous painting from our collection. We don't know if we can trust him though...
Milena got caught by soldiers and is being held in this Military Warehouse. We could try to reach her, but this place is heavily guarded by armed men and going there could be extremely dangerous...

We have to build a second heater to heat the Museum more efficiently. The temperature inside is dropping rapidly, so we should keep the temperature above 10 degrees to make sure this piercing cold won't hurt us.
The children's books entrusted to the care of the Museum went where they were needed most: to the orphanage. They helped the kids to cope with their worst memories.
The children's books entrusted to the care of the Museum weren't lost when Colonel Markov intercepted the collection at the mountain pass. Anja decided to keep them for the kids in the orphanage.
The children's books entrusted to the care of the Museum were safely stored in a bank vault with the rest of the collection.
The manuscript disappeared after Anja agreed to part with it in exchange for passage through the tunnels. It was a difficult decision, but it bought the safety and well-being of Adam's charges.
The manuscript fell into the hands of Colonel Markov along with the rest of the collection.
Thanks to the choices Anja made, the manuscript was kept safe in a bank vault until the war ended.
Determined to evacuate the collection from the war zone, Anja took Colonel Markov up on his offer and handed over the painting to him. Alas, he never intended to keep his end of the deal and took over the whole collection.
Determined to secure a way out of the war zone, Anja took Colonel Markov up on his offer and handed over the painting to him. When she changed her mind, it was too late: the Colonel disappeared along with the painting.
To save the collection, Anja had to make many hard choices, but she didn't let the pearl of the Museum's collection fall into Colonel Markov’s hands. The painting was hidden in a vault until the end of the siege.
Despite the desperate circumstances and her determination to save the collection, Anja decided not to give the documents to Taras the fence, not knowing the fate that he had planned for the people he sought.
Having no good choices and determined to save the collection, Anja decided to give the documents to Taras the fence, not knowing the fate that he had planned for the people he sought.
Unable to trust either Colonel Markov or Taras the fence, Anja faced a difficult choice. Her decision led to the Colonel's taking over most of the collection. He used the cultural cleansing as an opportunity to get rich, smuggling the artworks abroad and auctioning them piecemeal.
Unable to trust either Colonel Markov or Taras the fence, Anja faced a difficult choice. Thanks to her decision, the collection was safely stored in a bank vault – to which Taras the fence still had access...
Anja gave up an item from her private collection – a precious token of her memories – to save the Museum's artworks.
Crow, the car mechanic, wanted Anja to give him gold for car parts, but she found another way to acquire them. The necklace remained in her possession.
I need something to heat my place.
I've already burnt everything I had.
I don't think you really have much of a choice...
Hey, you're not hostile right? I'm just looking for something.
Hey, you won't hurt us, right? We need help!
Can you do something? Please help us!
I owe you my life!
There's blood on the floor, everything is in mess.
There's nothing left of the family that lived here.

It's not something I should be eating while pregnant...
Force Final Cut content
Raw meat can't possibly be good for the baby.
Digging without a shovel? I hope the effort doesn't hurt my baby.
That's too much... I really wish I had a shovel...
This is really hard work, I wish someone else could do it...
That's not something I should be doing while pregnant.
That's not a job for a pregnant woman, but at least I have a shovel.
I never thought I'd have to dig while being pregnant.
Never thought I'd have to be pregnant in such circumstances.
This place might be safe enough for me and my baby.
A coulpe of improvements and perhaps it could be livable.
I'd rather not give birth here... but we can stay here until it's safe.
I'd better stay in for the sake of the baby.
I won't go anywhere. It's relatively safer inside.
I hope I won't have to give birth here.
I will stay here unless it becomes too dangerous.
I hope we can find enough food to make it through.
Will I find a doctor if I need them?
I hope I can make myself useful, without putting my baby in harm's way.
I must eat something, my baby needs nutrition!
I can't stand this hunger anymore. For God's sake I'm pregnant!
I need to eat something, I'm starving with my child!
Hey... we dont' want any trouble. Don't touch any of our stuff.

Oh, how I'd love to eat some cucumbers with jam.
I'm sorry baby, mommy has nothing better to eat.
Tonight the barbarians hit the Pogoren Museum with an air strike. The whole building is in flames, the scale of loss, while still unknown, is going to be catastrophic.
Do you want to buy some food?
I don't have much, but you can buy some food.
Look, we can't fuck this up. We get in, take him out, and run out of here, understood?
Ah... Please don't mind my younger sister. She's a little touchy, since our father died.
At least I'm not a robot, like the rest of you...
I don't understand how can you even think about bussiness at a time like this...
It's over... Father's bakery is done for. We should focus more on survival instead of wasting our time here.
We just need to fix it a bit, to make it more secure.
Let's start with cleaning all this mess. And please check if you could find anything useful around here.
It already looks pretty nice, but there are still many things we'll need for survival.
Man... it would be nice to have a bed in here...
Yeah. I think it already looks much better then that last place we checked.
^CharacterName^ cares about strangers more than me...
If ^CharacterName^ really liked me, {mr|he}{fr|she} would've kept those bandages for me.
If ^CharacterName^ likes strangers so much, {mr|he}{fr|she} can go live with them!
Yeah, why don't we give away everything we have!
It's sad, but ^CharacterName^ had no choice. We really need supplies.
We sometimes have to do ugly things to make it through.
We're no better than the thugs from the military.
We've become the very monsters we fear.
It was nice of those people at the pharmacy to share their stuff with ^CharacterName^.
It could be better, but at least those kind people gave us some things.
I'm not sure if ^CharacterName^ is telling me the whole truth.
Those people ^CharacterName^ told me about must be really stupid to give us all their stuff!
At least we don't have it as bad as that guy at the pharmacy.
I guess it could be worse.
I should make sure we've got enough bandages, just in case.
We could take advantage of bandages being so valuable.
Whether you live or die, depends on access to such a simple thing.
Before the war, I'd never given bandages a second thought.
That wounded man at the pharmacy... he'll die without our help.
We can't help others... we can hardly survive ourselves.
I should've done something to help him...
I'm useless...
I feel ^CharacterName^ should've helped that man at the pharmacy.
If we help others, they might help us in turn.
I trust ^CharacterName^ had our best interest in mind.
{mr|He}{fr|She} would've helped that man if it were possible.
^CharacterName^ would've helped that man, if we weren't starved for bandages...
So many people get hurt, bandages have become indispensible.
We're so powerless...
We couldn't even help that man...
If one of us gets hurt, nobody will help us.
I feel it's my fault ^CharacterName^ didn't help that man.
What would have happened to those children if I hadn't been in the park?
I'm glad I protected those children. I hope they're still okay.
I protected those children this time... but who'll do it next time?
Children are so vulnerable, especially now that the world's gone mad.
^CharacterName^ did well in the park.
Helping those children was the right thing to do.
Nobody is safe in this city anymore.
^CharacterName^ might have got killed in the park.
^CharacterName^ protected those children, but who's there to protect them now?
Poor children, I can't bear to think what horrors they're going through.
^CharacterName^ met some children and helped them.
I wish ^CharacterName^ brought those children here. We could play together!
I wish ^CharacterName^ cared about me as much as {mr|he}{fr|she} cares about other children...
I don't think ^CharacterName^ likes me, {mr|he}{fr|she} doesn't take me to the park to play...
I should've helped those kids...
If something happens to them, I'll never forgive myself.
I wonder if those poor kids made it through the park.
All alone, they must've been really frightened...
^CharacterName^ should have helped those children...
^CharacterName^ left those children to their fate... How could {mr|he}{fr|she}?
I overheard that ^CharacterName^ left some children in danger.
Left alone in the park at night... that's horrifying!
I would've helped those children, but I'm so small and weak...
I know I'm useless, I't would be better if I were dead.
Why are peolpe so cruel to one another?
War makes men give in to their basest instincts.
I saved that one girl, but how many were less fortunate?
The abuse women have to suffer during the war is horrifying.
That girl was lucky ^CharacterName^ was there.
It was very brave of ^CharacterName^ to help that girl.
If ^CharacterName^ hadn't been there... I'd better not think about it.
How can men be so brutal...
Humans behave worse than beasts...
In war the innocent suffer and the vile prosper...
^CharacterName^ saved a girl from some evil men! {mr|He}{fr|She}'s a hero!
When I grow up I wanna be as strong as ^CharacterName^!
I've heard some men attacked a girl, how could they?
Are all men evil?
I keep seeing the face of that girl from the brewery...
Why didn't I help her? Why?
An innocent girl got murdered, and there was nothing ^CharacterName^ could do...
Sooner or later we'll all end up like that girl...
^CharacterName^ could've saved that girl.
What happened to that girl was horrible.
Should I really take such huge risks to help others?
That encounter at the brewery could've ended badly.
What world have we come to live in?
People murder one another over a bunch of scraps...
^CharacterName^ took a great risk at the bakery.
^CharacterName^ helped that family. Will they help us in turn?
People are killing each other, the soldiers just have to wait...
Morality dies first...
Something really bad happened last night...
I don't know what happened, but everyone is really sad.
Bad things happen all the time and there's nothing we can do.
Sooner or later something bad will happen to me.
^CharacterName^ was watchful which maybe saved someone's life.
I'm lucky to have ^CharacterName^.
I don't want ^CharacterName^ to risk {mr|his}{fr|her} life for others!
I just want ^CharacterName^ to protect me.
I was lucky to have escaped those bandits.
There wasn't much I could do for that family.
Maybe I could've done something to warn that family...
I feel guilty I didn't warn that family about the bandits.
I did nothing to stop those thugs... I was terrified...
People got hurt because I failed to act...
Bad things happen outside at night...
I don't want ^CharacterName^ to leave at night...
That poor family in the bakery...
If only ^CharacterName^ had warned them...
I'd rather not think what they did to that family...
It's just a matter of time before they come for us next...
^CharacterName^ came home sad, but I don't know why...
I wish ^CharacterName^ was happier and could cheer me up...
Letting go of those bandages was hard, but maybe it'll pay off in the future.
Bandages are valuable, but so is medicine. We might be better off this way.
We need bandages, I couldn't afford to share them.
I pity that man at the pharmacy, but helping others comes second to our survival.
I did what I had to do, to ensure we make it through.
If only there was another way to get what we need... But there isn't, so we just have to grit our teeth and carry on.
Helping those children was risky, but I just had to do it.
Children are our future, we need to protect them.
I couldn't risk confrontation in the park... What if I'd got hurt, or killed? Who'd have brought back supplies?
Shame about those kids, but our survival comes first. Enough said.
That was risky! I acted without thinking. But at least I'm alive and that girl is safe.
I acted on impulse, and it might have ended badly. I gotta be more careful.
If I'd tried to intervene, it would be my corpse lying there right now.
There was nothing I could've done. Those thugs would've killed me!
That was a hell of a risk. I'm glad I made it back.
I shouldn't take such risks if I am to make it through.
If I'd tried to warn that family, chances are I wouldn't have made it back alive.
I didn't want to risk confrontation with those thugs, returning with supplies seemed far more important.
I know it's tough, but when I looked into that man's eyes, I knew I just had to give him those bandages.
We could be in the same position, we need to make sure we have friends in the city.
This war will not turn us into animals, so long as we stick together and share what we have.
I just couldn't leave that man without aid.
I'm afraid those bandages may not be enough to save that man... but at least we tried.
We do what we can to help others, but it'll never be enough.
If we had enough bandages, I might have shared some with that guy.
We need every bandage we can get our hands on, we can't afford to share them.
That wounded man? Tough luck. Our well being comes first.
We have our own problems, that man must get his bandages elsewhere.
Even if I'd given bandages to that man, that wouldn't haae been enough.
We can't save every wounded person in the city. It's impossible.
That man really needed bandages... We should get him some.
I should return to that man with bandages, if I can find some.
I can't go round the city just giving away our bandages to everyone who needs them.
It'd be ironic if I'd given away our bandages only to find myself needing them later.
It pains me to think of that wounded man, lying there dying and helpless...
That poor wounded guy... this war has brought us so much suffering...
I'd have helped those kids if we didn't have more pressing problems.
Helping those children could've put us in danger. I couldn't risk that.
How could I leave those kids all alone... what was I thinking?
I'm so ashamed I didn't help those kids. I was scared, I'm such a coward.
If I risked my head for every lost child in the city, I'd long be dead.
I'm not a hero, I just want to make it through this war. If I take unnecessary risks, I won't.
There are many lost kids in the city, it's not my responsibility to look after them all.
Kids wandering alone at night... That's just asking for trouble. Stupid brats.
Those kids were not my problem. We have more pressing issues to deal with.
Kids should stay at home or in the shelter, not wander aroud the city all alone.
I didn't help those kids, and if something happens to them it'll have been my fault.
I know I'll be the one to blame if those kids from the park get hurt, but I just couldn't help them.
If I'd tried to help those children, I'd probably have made things worse. I'm so useless.
Even if I'd helped those children this once, they'd get into trouble another time.
Risk my head for those kids? Fuck that, they're unlikely to survive anyway.
Who cares about some stray brats? The city's full of them, there's nothing I can do about it.
I wouldn't have done it if we weren't so starved for supplies.
Maybe what I did was immoral, but this war has changed the rules we used to live by.
What have I done? How have I become a criminal?
What was I thinking? What I did was despicable!
It's war, what was I supposed to do? Come back empty handed?
When all this is over, those people won't be alive to tell anyone I robbed them.
These supplies were wasted on them, we'll make better use of them.
What I did changes nothing. They wouldn't make it either way.
How did I get this stuff? Get off my back and be glad we have it.
Don't ask me how I got these supplies. We do what needs to be done.
I commited a crime, and for what? We'll soon run out of supplies anyway.
War has driven me to do horrible things, maybe I don't deserve to live?
Who's to protect helpless children if not us?
We must make sure children grow up to be kind, despite the trauma of the war.
I wish I could've done more for those children.
It pains me to see children scarred by the experience of war.
I was there to help those children this time, but their chances of survival are still very slim.
Children are easy prey to all sorts of thugs, especially now.
Sadly, helping those children once will not prevent them from becoming traumatised by this war.
I was there to help those kids, but what will happen next time, when I'm not there?
I'm glad I saved that girl, though it was very dangerous. I have to be careful.
That girl was really lucky I was there. I hope she'll be alright.
If we don't stand up to bullies, who will?
The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.
Saving that girl wasn't worth risking my life.
That girl is safe now, for all that it's worth.
Stupid girl. I risked my life for her.
I shouldn't have risked my life for some stupid girl.
I saved that girl this time, but there won't always be someone to protect her.
Girls have it really hard when all civilisation collapses.
You can save someone sometime, burt you can't save everyone all the time.
Evil is part of human nature, and there's nothing we can do about it.
It's unsafe enough even without such bastards prowling the streets! I'd kill them all if I could.
I wish I could kill every motherfucker preying on the weak.
I risked my life for some dumb bitch. What was I thinking?
Now that was one bloody stupid rescue. I should've kept away from trouble.
I wanted to help that girl, but I have others to care for. I couldn't take that risk.
Risking my life for that girl would lead us nowhere. I'm sorry but it's true.
I wanted to help that girl, but I was afraid. It turns out I'm a coward...
I didn't save that poor girl... I stood by, did nothing, and now she's dead.
She was neither the first victim of this war, nor will she be the last. War is hell.
What good would it do, if I'd let myself get killed trying to save that girl?
What was I supposed to do? Let myself get killed for that girl?
If I'd tried to stop them, they would've killed me too.
Wandering the city by herself... she was tempting fate. What was I supposed to do?
All alone... she got what was coming. There was nothing I could've done.
I couldn't help that poor girl. If I'd tried, I'd be lying there dead along with her.
If I'd tried to help that woman, I would've just got myself killed.
I'll never forgive myself for not helping that woman.
I didn't save that woman... I'll never forget her face.
They murdered that woman in cold blood. They would've done the same with me if I'd tried to stop them.
Risking my life to save that woman would've been pointless. There was nothing I could've done.
I'm glad I warned that family. Maybe they can somehow help us in return.
Good thing I warned that family, now there'll be fewer bandits to plague us.
I don't even want to think what would've happened if that family had been surprised by the bandits.
If I hadn't warned that family, the bandits would've taken them by surprise.
I risked a lot to warn that family. They had better show some gratitude.
I risked my head for that family. I hope it was worth it.
How much longer before everyone turns to violence to survive?
No matter how many times we foil bandits, there always seems to be more of them.
The situation in the city is growing worse by the day, and bandits are becoming ever more persistent. We're fighting a losing battle.
What could've pushed those men to commit such acts of violence? Hunger? Base instincts?
Bandit scum, may they rot in hell.
Those bandits are no longer men, they're vermin.
Maybe warning that family wasn't such a good idea after all. I could come back later to collect the leftovers.
If I hadn't warned that family, the thugs would've done the dirty work, and I could scavenge whatever they'd have missed.
If those bandits come for us next, we must be ready to fend them off.
Perhaps there was something I could've done to help that family, but It would've been very dangerous.
I failed to warn that family, and whatever happened to them is my fault.
I should have warned that family, but it's too late now. What's done is done.
Leaving the shelter is getting riskier by the day. I'd gladly let someone else do it.
I'm fed up with risking my life just to get some scraps!
I'd better avoid that bakery, it's not safe there.
How are we to survive with all those bandits around?
I didn't risk my life for that family. So what? They're not our concern.
I would've risked my head for family or friends, but for strangers?
Poor family, I can imagine the same thing happening to us.
We're all just prey to bandits. They'll come for us sooner or later.
I'm worthless. I couldn't even warn that family...
I I'd warned that family woul'd they have been able to repel those bandits? Probably not...
Fuck! That was a close one. I think I need a drink to calm my nerves.
Fucking bandits! They're all over the city, like maggots on a corpse.
I'm glad I made it back alive. I'm not sure I wanna come back there, maybe someone else could go.
That was a close one! Maybe tonight I should stay in the shelter.
Shame about those bandages. No telling where or when we can find another batch.
Those were some good bandages. Let's hope we don't regret giving them away.
We may miss those bandages, but giving them away was the right thing to do. Those people are just like us.
If I'd been in ^CharacterName^'s place, I'd have saved up those bandages for us.
I'm glad we could help those people.
Those bandages may have saved that man's life. I'm glad ^CharacterName^ was there to help.
Damn, bandages are in short supply. We should not let go of them so lightly.
Sure, why don't we let go of all our bandages. It's not like there's war going on.
Giving away those bandages might yet come back to bite us.
^CharacterName^ shouldn't have given away our bandages. How can we survive without them?
Is ^CharacterName^ mad? We could really use those bandages.
It wasn't smart to give those bandages away. We may yet come to regret it.
Those bandages will serve that man better than us. I don't think we'll make it anyway.
What's a bunch of bandages, when there's almost nothing left anyway.
^CharacterName^ helped those peolpe because {mr|he}{fr|she} is kind.
We should always help those in need.
Bad people hurt others all the time now.
If I get hurt will anyone help me?
How could ^CharacterName^ give away our bandages? What if I need them?
Giving away our things to others is so stupid!
It'd be best if we held to every bandage we can find. That man should get his own elsewhere.
Helping others is noble, but we cannot spare any vital supplies.
He's got his woman to look after him, he doesn't need our help.
His woman can easily aquire bandages from the military. They'd be happy to help her.
We should help that wounded man. Maybe it's not to late!
Maybe we can still save that wounded man, we should at least try!
^CharacterName^ met some wounded guy, but couldn't do anything to help him.
If I'm not careful and get hurt, nobody will help me. I'll end up like that man ^CharacterName^ told me about.
I should get a gun, or a knife, so that nobody can hurt me, like they hurt that man at the pharmacy.
It's probably too late to save that wounded man.
Poor man, there's little we can do to save him. Bandages probably wouldn't be enough anyway.
^CharacterName^ did what had to be done. Sadly, it's us or them.
I don't condemn ^CharacterName^ for stealing to ensure our survival. I would've done the same.
^CharacterName^ tarnished {mr|himself}{fr|herself} for our good. That was very brave of {mr|him}{fr|her}.
^CharacterName^ did what {mr|he}{fr|she} did for us. We should appreciate it.
We might survive, but we will live out our days in shame.
If we make it through this hell, what stories will we tell our children? How can we tell them the truth?
If stealing is the only way to make sure I live, so be it.
If stealing means I'll make it through, I'm okay with it.
^CharacterName^ brought us some gifts he got from a friendly couple.
It was very kind of that couple to give ^CharacterName^ all those things.
I think ^CharacterName^ isn't telling me the whole truth about these things {mr|he}{fr|she} brought.
Did ^CharacterName^ steal those things and lie to me about it?
The strong take from the weak. I must make sure I'm strong!
If someone tries to steal from us, I'll kill them!
^CharacterName^ took a risk for those children. It could've ended badly.
It's good ^CharacterName^ aided those kids. They are our future.
Preying on helpless children is disgusting, I'm glad ^CharacterName^ protected those kids.
Children must be protected against violence and abuse, lest they become violent themselves.
I was relieved to hear ^CharacterName^ helped those poor kids.
Those kids got really lucky ^CharacterName^ was there to help them. I'm glad {mr|he}{fr|she} did.
Helping stray kids is good and all, but we need to keep focused on the more important stuff.
Who cares about some stray kids, the city's full of them. We have ourselves to look after.
^CharacterName^ is a true hero! He helped children in distress!
When I grow up I wanna be brave and strong like ^CharacterName^.
^CharacterName^ helped those kids this time, but I doubt they'll make it through the war unscathed.
Kids wandering around the city alone are just asking for trouble.
I'm pretty sure those kids are going to get in serious trouble sooner or later.
I wouldn't be surprised if we were never going to see those kids again.
Children wandering the city on their own... I don't even want to imagine what could've happened to them.
^CharacterName^ won't always be there to protect those kids. They're bound to get into serious trouble eventually.
I'm afraid! I don't wanna end up alone like those children...
I'd be terrified If I had to go through that park alone at night...
When I grow up, I'll always carry a gun, so that nobody can hurt me.
When I'm older and bigger, and stronger, and someone tries to hurt me, I'll kill them!
I can't blame ^CharacterName^ for not helping those kids. Why take unnecessary risks?
Survival is hard even without taking risks for strangers. ^CharacterName^ was right not to put {mr|himself}{fr|herself} in danger.
It was a hard decision to make, so I won't judge ^CharacterName^. I don't know what I would've done if I were {mr|him}{fr|her}.
^CharacterName^ risking {mr|his}{fr|her} life would have put us all in danger. {mr|He}{fr|She} made the right decision.
How could ^CharacterName^ ignore the pleas of little children?
Not helping those kids in need was heinous. ^CharacterName^ should be ashamed.
What's with all this fuss about some random kids? I couldn't care less.
Who can tell for sure if those kids weren't going to lure ^CharacterName^ into a trap?
I've heard ^CharacterName^ met some other children in the park, but unfortunately they couldn't come to visit us.
I'd like to meet other children. Maybe next time ^CharacterName^ will take me along?
Even if ^CharacterName^ had helped those kids once, what difference would it make in the long run?
Those kids, like many others, simply have no chance of surviving this war.
If it were up to me, I wouldn't have let those kids end up in that mess in the first place.
^CharacterName^ did not help those kids, but it wasn't {mr|his}{fr|her} responsibility after all.
I don't even want to imagine what happened to those kids when ^CharacterName^ left them all alone in that dark park.
Poor kids... ^CharacterName^ ignored their cries for help, just like the international community ignores ours.
I'm lonely... I wish I had some friends my age to play with...
I never see other children... I feel lonely...
^CharacterName^ met some children in the park! Why am I not allowed to go out anywhere? I hate this place!
Everyone can go out but me! I hate being treated like a little child!
What ^CharacterName^ did at the brewery was bloody risky.
^CharacterName^ put {mr|himself}{fr|herself} in danger for that girl. That was an unnecessary risk.
^CharacterName^ is one brave {mr|man}{fr|woman}.
To risk {mr|his}{fr|her} life like that, in order to save someone? That was very brave of ^CharacterName^.
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ had the courage to stand up for that girl.
That was very brave of ^CharacterName^ to put {mr|himself}{fr|herself} in danger for that girl
^CharacterName^ saved that girl, but how many are less fortunate?
It seems that for every person willing to risk their life for others, there are two willing to hurt someone just because they can.
^CharacterName^ was reckless to risk {mr|his}{fr|her} life for that girl.
If I were ^CharacterName^, I wouldn't have risked my life for that girl.
^CharacterName^ stood up to bullies, which isn't an easy thing to do!
^CharacterName^ was very brave and fought some bullies!
Bullies are the worst... They make your life hell.
Why do the strong hurt the helpless? Why?
I hate bullies! One day I'll get a gun and kill them all.
When I grow up I'll kill anyone who tries to hurt me.
If I were ^CharacterName^ I wouldn't have risked my life either.
That woman's life was forfeit. If ^CharacterName^ had tried to help her, {mr|he}{fr|she} would've got killed too.
It's hard to say what I'd have done if it had been me there instead of ^CharacterName^.
^CharacterName^ made a difficult call, but I wasn't there so I won't judge.
I can't believe ^CharacterName^ did nothing to save that woman. I'm speechless.
How could ^CharacterName^ just let those men murder that woman?
^CharacterName^ was smart not to get involved. I'd have done the same.
Intervening would've been reckless. ^CharacterName^ acted sensibly.
Something terrible happened but no one is telling me what it was.
I wish people would take me more seriously, and told me everything.
^CharacterName^ was powerless to prevent that murder. We can barely defend ourselves.
We can't even defend ourselves, how could we possibly defend others?
I don't care about that woman, the importnat thing is that ^CharacterName^ didn't get killed.
I wouldn't have risked my life for that woman too. We have plenty of our own problems.
^CharacterName^ didn't save that woman and now she's dead. It's {mr|his}{fr|her} fault.
^CharacterName^ is to blame for that woman's death.
Something horrible happened. Again. We should get used to it.
Another bad thing happened. I don't even care anymore.
I hate it when people know something and they don't tell me.
Why does no one tell me anything? I'm not a child anymore!
^CharacterName^ did the right thing warning those people. Maybe we can trade with them now.
The lesson here is to always leave someone on guard.
^CharacterName^ showed those bandits that we will not be intimidated, we will fight.
It's good to know that we aren't the only ones repelling the bandits.
Whoever those poeple are, ^CharacterName^ was right to warn them.
Nobody deserves to be murdered in their sleep. I'm glad ^CharacterName^ warned that family about the bandits.
I'm sure glad it wasn't me scavenging last night!
I need to get myself a gun and ammo, in case someone decides to attack our shelter.
^CharacterName^ warned some family about bandits who wanted to break into their home. {mr|He}{fr|She} was very brave!
I feel much safer when ^CharacterName^ is around.
^CharacterName^ warned those people, but would they warn us if we were in danger?
^CharacterName^ risked much to warn that family. Would they have done the same for us?
I guess it's better if bandits try to hit other houses, and leave us alone.
The fewer bandits there are, the better.
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ warned those people, but it seems that bandits are becoming ever more brazen.
It's horrible how some people are willing to murder others just to get what they want.
I'm scared that bandits will come to our house to hurt us!
Who will protect me if the bandits come when ^CharacterName^ isn't here?
If bandits come to our house, ^CharacterName^ will kill them for me.
When I grow up, I'll kill everyone who comes to my house uninvited.
It's hard to blame ^CharacterName^ for not warning that family. It was a dangerous situation.
We mustn't get caught by surprise like that family. We should always put someone on watch.
Maybe ^CharacterName^ didn't warn that family, but {mr|he}{fr|she} came back to warn us, which is far more important.
^CharacterName^ came back and warned us about the bandits. We must be prepared to repel them.
I don't understand why ^CharacterName^ didn't warn that family. It couldn't have been too hard!
If I were ^CharacterName^, I'd have told that family about the danger.
I must make sure I have some weapons and ammo, in case those bandits decide to hit us next.
We can't let bandits surprise us, like they did that family. We must be vigilant.
^CharacterName^ was in danger last night. I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to leave after dark! What if {mr|he}{fr|she} doesn't come back?
I don't know what I'll do if ^CharacterName^ doesn't come back one day!
Once those bandits are done with that family in the bakery, they'll probably come for us.
Once they've cleaned out the bakery, those thugs will search for new prey. We might be it.
I don't care about that family, I'm just glad ^CharacterName^ came back in one piece.
If those bandits come for us next, we'll be ready for them.
Have we become so numb that we no longer care about others?
^CharacterName^ should've at least tried to warn that family...
Why can't ^CharacterName^ stay with me at night? I don't want {mr|him}{fr|her} to get killed!
I'm worried whenever ^CharacterName^ leaves for the night...What if {mr|he}{fr|she} gets killed?
I hate it when ^CharacterName^ leaves for the night! I hate it!
If ^CharacterName^ gets {mr|himself}{fr|herself} killed, I'll never forgive {mr|him}{fr|her}!
Injured man
Despite our tough situation, we shared our bandages with the injured man in the pharmacy.
We didn't share bandages with an injured man we encountered at the pharmacy.
We robbed helpless people
We robbed a woman tending to a wounded man.
Children in need
^CharacterName^ met a couple of children on their own, and helped them get through the park safely.
^CharacterName^ met a couple of children on their own, but did not help them get through the park.
A girl in distress
Two men brutally assaulted a girl but ^CharacterName^ stood up to them and saved her.
Two men brutally assaulted and murdered a girl. ^CharacterName^ could only watch it happen.
Break-in
^CharacterName^ noticed bandits trying to break into a bakery, and {mr|he}{fr|she} warned the family who lived there.
^CharacterName^ noticed bandits trying to break into a bakery, but {mr|he}{fr|she} didn't warn the family who lived there.
Why can't we cook it? I shouldn't do it to my child.
Probably the healthiest food we can get...
It's tasteless, but it'll keep us strong, my darling.
We will survive on this. Mommy will make sure you live.
After the war I will cook for you much better food. I promise.
I'm so hungry, it's becoming unbearable!
I know you're hungry darling, mommy will find something to eat.
I'll get some food to keep you strong and healthy, I promise.
We need food! It's not about me, it's about the baby.
Finally, an amount of food that'll keep us strong.
I wish we could eat like that every day.
Sleep now my darling, we'll eat again tomorrow.
I promise I'll never let you go hungry, when all this is over.
I'ts not very serious, but I'd better tend to it anyway.
I should bandage it before it gets worse.
It's not just about me, I have to think about the baby.
Even a flesh wound can start festering in such conditions.
I'm bleeding! I only hope the baby will be alright...
I must see a doctor, or at least a nurse. It hurt's so much!
I need medical attention, for the sake of my baby!
Mommy is hurt, baby, but we will be alright, we have to!
I'm bleeding! Someone help me, for the sake of my child!
Am I dying? It can't end like this! What about my baby...
Anyone, please save me! Save my child!
There's so much blood! Can anyone stop this bleeding?! Please...
I don't feel well, I should stay in bed.
Even the slightest ilness might be bad for my baby.
I think it's bad enough that I should get some meds...
I hope I can get meds that are safe for pregnant women.
I'm shivering.. I really need meds...
I need to be healthy for my baby, someone help me...
Please give me some meds, for the sake of my unborn child!
I don't want to lose my baby, please help me get back to health...
I'm really tired, and being pregnant doesn't help.
I must rest for my baby's sake.
Mommy needs some sleep baby, I know you do to.
I'm exhausted, I need at least a couple of hours of sleep...
If I don't rest now, it may be bad for the baby.
Exhaustion might lead to miscarriage... God, don't let that happen!
I can't fight off sleep anymore, I'm too exhausted...
Mommy will just lie down for a short while...
I must rest, even for just a couple of hours....
I really shouldn't be sleeping on the floor, for the sake of the baby.
I need a proper bed, especially in my condition.
I can't sleep on the ground, my belly makes it unbearable.
It's bad for my child if I don't sleep in bed.
I must get warm to keep my baby safe!
Mommy is trying to keep you warm baby, but it's so cold...
Oh God, don't let us freeze to death!
All this will be over one day, and mommy will show you the world.
I feel we can survive this hell after all.
Don't worry, mommy will always be there for you.
You are the future of this country my baby. You will make it a better place.
It is always darkest just before the dawn.
I'm glad you're not born yet. You will have no memories of all this.
You will have a happy childhood. I'll do everything to make it so, I promise.
This is not how I had envisioned my pregnancy...
Will this war have ended by the time you are born?
How can I hope to give birth in such conditions?
Our situation is getting worse by the day...
I'm afraid we might not make it after all...
I'm losing hope...
Will I ever hold you in my arms?
How can I bring you into such a horrible world...?
I'm sorry baby, mommy did everything she could...
I'm glad ^CharacterName^ helped that hospital. Those people working there are very brave.
How could ^CharacterName^ steal from the hospital? We may yet need their help!
Those poor people... I must believe ^CharacterName^ robbed them for the good of my baby.
Oh God... That elderly couple is dead. It must be our fault.
What ^CharacterName^ did was vile... Would {mr|he}{fr|she} have done it, if it weren't for me and the baby?
It was very kind of ^CharacterName^ to share with that homeless man. I want my child to live in a world filled with kindness.
^CharacterName^ did not share food with that homeles man, but perhaps {mr|he}{fr|she} was thinking about my baby. The baby is all that matters.
I'm sure ^CharacterName^ would've helped that man, if it were only possible.
Thanks goodness ^CharacterName^ helped that man reach his child! If {mr|he}{fr|she} hadn't... Better not think about it.
Another victim of nationalism and hatred. How can I bring a child into such world?
Poor girl... I hope for her sake, she doesn't get pregnant... A child should be the product of love.
Poor girl... I hope for her sake, she doesn't get pregnant... A child should be the product of love.
If ^CharacterName^ hadn't been there to save that girl... I don't even want to think about it.
That brothel... How can men be so vile and repulsive? I was so lucky my husband was nothing like it.
How can people do such horrible things to one another, what has this world come to?
How do people become such cold murderers? Is it the issue of upbringing? Lack of education? Not enough love in life?
Goodwill and trust are necessary if we are to rebuild our society for our children.
I wish ^CharacterName^ had helped that man. We must strive to be good and kind despite the adversities.
I wish ^CharacterName^ hadn't stolen from those poeple. What goes around comes around.
I'm relieved to hear that ^CharacterName^ helped those children. Children need all the protection they can get, especially at a time like this.
I can't believe ^CharacterName^ left those children without help! They're children for God's sake! They need all the help they can get!
How can men become so bestial as to attack a helpless woman? I'm glad ^CharacterName^ was there to save that woman.
How can men become so bestial as to attack a helpless woman? Repulsive!
It is admittedly safer indoors, but I'm frightened to think someone could come to hurt us.
We're not safe here! Someone could come to murder us in out sleep!.
I must be careful not to contract the disease from ^CharacterName^. I can't take any risks with the baby in my belly.
Oh no... ^CharacterName^...
How horrible! Poor ^CharacterName^...
We've lost ^CharacterName^...
^CharacterName^... So tragic...
Bandits came at night and murdered ^CharacterName^. If only there had been something I could have done.
Maybe if I weren't pregnant I could have fought the bandits, and ^CharacterName^ would still be with us.
How horrible! We must make sure no one else dies of cold
If only we could have made this place warmer, ^CharacterName^ would still be alive.
So tragic... Perhaps ^CharacterName^ shouldn't have taken that risk...
^CharacterName^'s death is a painful loss.
Unless we get our hands on some meds, we won't make it!
We really need to get some meds, otherwise we'll have no chance.
We're starving... We must get our hands on some food, and quickly.
We won't make it without food. There must be something we can do to get it!
I guess this is it then. Without food we're done for... My poor baby, how I'd wish to hold you in my arms at least once.
It seems it's the end of the road for us... I'll never see my baby...
Everyone is in such poor shape... are we doomed?
Is this how it ends? With everyone dying of wounds?
We failed ^CharacterName^... We should've done something! Anything!
It's our fault that ^CharacterName^ took {mr|his}{fr|her} own life. We should've shown more support.
How could have ^CharacterName^ done such a thing to us?! What shall we do now?
What ^CharacterName^ did, was despicable. How could {mr|he}{fr|she}!? How will we survive now?
I don't think it was wise of ^CharacterName^ to leave on {mr|his}{fr|her} own like that.
^CharacterName^ shouldn't have left. We would have better chances of survival if we stayed together.
It's entirely our fault that ^CharacterName^ left us. We were horrible to {mr|him}{fr|her}.
Now wonder ^CharacterName^ left us. Who would be able to put up with such disregard?
Poor ^CharacterName^, everyone's so mean to {mr|him}{fr|her}.
We can't treat ^CharacterName^ like that anymore, it's so unfair...
I hope ^CharacterName^ is better now. Protecting children is our primary responsibility.
Oh my God, how could we have failed ^OtherCharacterName^ and ^CharacterName^ so much, they decided they were better off on their own?!
Thanks goodness there's a doctor at the hospital! It's a relief to know he will help me if there's a need.
